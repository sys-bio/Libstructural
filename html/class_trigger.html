<div class="textblock"><p>{core} The trigger expression for an SBML <em>event</em>.</p>
<p>An <a class="el" href="class_event.html">Event</a> object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected. The <a class="el" href="class_trigger.html">Trigger</a> construct in SBML is used to define a mathematical expression that determines when an <a class="el" href="class_event.html">Event</a> is <em>triggered</em>.</p>
<p>A <a class="el" href="class_trigger.html">Trigger</a> object in SBML Level&#160;2 and Level&#160;3 contains one subelement named "math" containing a MathML expression. The expression is evaluated as a value of type <code>boolean</code>. The exact moment at which the expression evaluates to <code>true</code> is the time point when the <a class="el" href="class_event.html">Event</a> is <em>triggered</em>. In SBML Level&#160;3, <a class="el" href="class_trigger.html">Trigger</a> has additional attributes that must be assigned values; they are discussed in a separate section below.</p>
<p>In SBML Level&#160;2 and SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;1, the "math" subelement is required, and it must evaluate to a <code>boolean</code> expression. In SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;2, those restrictions are relaxed: the "math" element is optional, and numeric values are allowed in Boolean contexts (a '0' is interpreted as <code>false</code>, and all other values are interpreted as <code>true</code>). If a <a class="el" href="class_trigger.html">Trigger</a> with no "math" is present in an <a class="el" href="class_event.html">Event</a>, that <a class="el" href="class_event.html">Event</a> will never <em>trigger</em>, unless that missing information is included in an SBML Level&#160;3 package.</p>
<p>An event only <em>triggers</em> when its <a class="el" href="class_trigger.html">Trigger</a> expression makes the transition in value from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code>. The event will also trigger at any subsequent time points when the trigger makes this transition; in other words, an event can be triggered multiple times during a simulation if its trigger condition makes the transition from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code> more than once. In SBML Level&#160;3, the behavior at the very start of simulation (i.e., at <em>t = 0</em>, where <em>t</em> stands for time) is determined in part by the boolean flag "initialValue". This and other additional features introduced in SBML Level&#160;3 are discussed further below.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="trigger-version-diffs"></a>
Version differences</h1>
<p>SBML Level&#160;3 Version&#160;1 introduces two required attributes on the <a class="el" href="class_trigger.html">Trigger</a> object: "persistent" and "initialValue". The rest of this introduction describes these two attributes.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="trigger-persistent"></a>
The "persistent" attribute on Trigger</h2>
<p>In the interval between when an <a class="el" href="class_event.html">Event</a> object <em>triggers</em> (i.e., its <a class="el" href="class_trigger.html">Trigger</a> object expression transitions in value from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code>) and when its assignments are to be <em>executed</em>, conditions in the model may change such that the trigger expression transitions back from <code>true</code> to <code>false</code>. Should the event's assignments still be made if this happens? Answering this question is the purpose of the "persistent" attribute on <a class="el" href="class_trigger.html">Trigger</a>.</p>
<p>If the boolean attribute "persistent" has a value of <code>true</code>, then once the event is triggered, all of its assignments are always performed when the time of execution is reached. The name <em>persistent</em> is meant to evoke the idea that the trigger expression does not have to be re-checked after it triggers if "persistent"=<code>true</code>. Conversely, if the attribute value is <code>false</code>, then the trigger expression is not assumed to persist: if the expression transitions in value back to <code>false</code> at any time between when the event triggered and when it is to be executed, the event is no longer considered to have triggered and its assignments are not executed. (If the trigger expression transitions once more to <code>true</code> after that point, then the event is triggered, but this then constitutes a whole new event trigger-and-execute sequence.)</p>
<p>The "persistent" attribute can be especially useful when <a class="el" href="class_event.html">Event</a> objects contain <a class="el" href="class_delay.html">Delay</a> objects, but it is relevant even in a model without delays if the model contains two or more events. As explained in the introduction to this section, the operation of all events in SBML (delayed or not) is conceptually divided into two phases, <em>triggering</em> and <em>execution</em>; however, unless events have priorities associated with them, SBML does not mandate a particular ordering of event execution in the case of simultaneous events. Models with multiple events can lead to situations where the execution of one event affects another event's trigger expression value. If that other event has "persistent"=<code>false</code>, and its trigger expression evaluates to <code>false</code> before it is to be executed, the event must not be executed after all.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="trigger-initialvalue"></a>
The "initialValue" attribute on Trigger</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, an event <em>triggers</em> when the mathematical expression in its <a class="el" href="class_trigger.html">Trigger</a> object transitions in value from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code>. An unanswered question concerns what happens at the start of a simulation: can event triggers make this transition at <em>t = 0</em>, where <em>t</em> stands for time?</p>
<p>In order to determine whether an event may trigger at <em>t = 0</em>, it is necessary to know what value the <a class="el" href="class_trigger.html">Trigger</a> object's "math" expression had immediately prior to <em>t = 0</em>. This starting value of the trigger expression is determined by the value of the boolean attribute "initialValue". A value of <code>true</code> means the trigger expression is taken to have the value <code>true</code> immediately prior to <em>t = 0</em>. In that case, the trigger cannot transition in value from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code> at the moment simulation begins (because it has the value <code>true</code> both before and after <em>t = 0</em>), and can only make the transition from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code> sometime <em>after</em> <em>t = 0</em>. (To do that, it would also first have to transition to <code>false</code> before it could make the transition from <code>false</code> back to <code>true</code>.) Conversely, if "initialValue"=<code>false</code>, then the trigger expression is assumed to start with the value <code>false</code>, and therefore may trigger at <em>t = 0</em> if the expression evaluates to <code>true</code> at that moment.</p>
