<div class="textblock"><dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>The optional <a class="el" href="class_delay.html">Delay</a> on <a class="el" href="class_event.html">Event</a> and the fact that multiple events may be simultaneously executed means there are two times to consider when computing the results of an event: the time at which the event is <em>triggered</em>, and the time at which assignments are <em>executed</em>. It is also possible to distinguish between the time at which the <a class="el" href="class_event_assignment.html">EventAssignment</a>'s expression is calculated, and the time at which the assignment is made: the expression could be evaluated at the same time the assignments are performed, i.e., when the event is <em>executed</em>, but it could also be defined to be evaluated at the time the event is <em>triggered</em>.</dd></dl>
<p>In SBML Level&#160;2 versions prior to Version&#160;4, the semantics of <a class="el" href="class_event.html">Event</a> time delays were defined such that the expressions in the event's assignments were always evaluated at the time the event was <em>triggered</em>. This definition made it difficult to define an event whose assignment formulas were meant to be evaluated at the time the event was <em>executed</em> (i.e., after the time period defined by the value of the <a class="el" href="class_delay.html">Delay</a> element, or after any other simultaneous event may have been <em>executed</em> and changed the model state). In SBML Level&#160;2 Version&#160;4, the attribute "useValuesFromTriggerTime" on <a class="el" href="class_event.html">Event</a> allows a model to indicate the time at which the event's assignments are intended to be evaluated. In SBML Level&#160;2, the attribute has a default value of <code>true</code>, which corresponds to the interpretation of event assignments prior to Version&#160;4: the values of the assignment formulas are computed at the moment the event is triggered, not after the delay. If "useValuesFromTriggerTime"=<code>false</code>, it means that the formulas in the event's assignments are to be computed after the delay, at the time the event is executed. In SBML Level&#160;3, the attribute is mandatory, not optional, and all events must specify a value for it. </p>
