<div class="textblock"><p>{core} Base class for SBML Level 3 package plug-ins.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="class_s_b_m_l_extension.html">SBMLExtension</a> class is a component of the libSBML package extension mechanism. It is an abstract class that is extended by each package extension implementation.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="ext-basics"></a>
Basic principles of SBML package extensions in libSBML</h1>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>SBML Level&#160;3's package structure permits modular extensions to the core SBML format. In libSBML, support for SBML Level&#160;3 packages is provided through optional <em>package extensions</em> that can be plugged into libSBML at the time it is built/compiled. Users of libSBML can thus choose which extensions are enabled in their software applications.</dd></dl>
<p>LibSBML defines a number of classes that developers of package extensions can use to implement support for an SBML Level&#160;3 package. These classes make it easier to extend libSBML objects with new attributes and/or subobjects as needed by a particular Level&#160;3 package. Three overall categories of classes make up libSBML's facilities for implementing package extensions. There are (1) classes that serve as base classes meant to be subclassed, (2) template classes meant to be instantiated rather than subclassed, and (3) support classes that provide utility features. A given package implementation for libSBML will take the form of code using these and other libSBML classes, placed in a subdirectory of <code>src/sbml/packages/</code>.</p>
<p>The basic libSBML distribution includes a number of package extensions implementing support for officially-endorsed SBML Level&#160;3 packages; among these are <em>Flux Balance Constraints</em> ("fbc"), <em>Hierarchical Model Composition</em> ("comp"), <em>Layout</em> ("layout"), and <em>Qualitative Models</em> ("qual"). They can serve as working examples for developers working to implement other packages.</p>
<p>Extensions in libSBML can currently only be implemented in C++ or C; there is no mechanism to implement them first in languages such as Java or Python. However, once implemented in C++ or C, language interfaces can be generated semi-automatically using the framework in place in libSBML. (The approach is based on using <a href="http://www.swig.org" target="_blank">SWIG</a> and facilities in libSBML's build system.)</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="sbmlextension-l2-special"></a>
Special handling for SBML LevelÂ 2</h1>
<dl class="section user"><dt></dt><dd>Due to the historical background of the SBML Layout package, libSBML implements special behavior for that package: it <em>always</em> creates a Layout plugin object for any SBML Level&#160;2 document it reads in, regardless of whether that document actually uses Layout constructs. This is unlike the case for SBML Level&#160;3 documents that use Layout; for them, libSBML will <em>not</em> create a plugin object unless the document actually declares the use of the Layout package (via the usual Level&#160;3 namespace declaration for Level&#160;3 packages).</dd></dl>
<p>This has the following consequence. If an application queries for the presence of Layout in an SBML Level&#160;2 document by testing only for the existence of the plugin object, <b>it will always get a positive result</b>; in other words, the presence of a Layout extension object is not an indication of whether a read-in Level&#160;2 document does or does not use SBML Layout. Instead, callers have to query explicitly for the existence of layout information. An example of such a query is the following code:</p>
<p>The special, always-available Level&#160;2 Layout behavior was motivated by a desire to support legacy applications. In SBML Level&#160;3, the Layout package uses the normal SBML Level&#160;3 scheme of requiring declarations on the SBML document element. This means that upon reading a model, libSBML knows right away whether it contains layout information. In SBML Level&#160;2, there is no top-level declaration because layout is stored as annotations in the body of the model. Detecting the presence of layout information when reading a Level&#160;2 model requires parsing the annotations. For efficiency reasons, libSBML normally does not parse annotations automatically when reading a model. However, applications that predated the introduction of Level&#160;3 Layout and the updated version of libSBML never had to do anything special to enable parsing layout; the facilities were always available for every Level&#160;2 model as long as libSBML was compiled with Layout support. To avoid burdening developers of legacy applications with the need to modify their software, libSBML provides backward compatibility by always preloading the Layout package extension when reading Level&#160;2 models. The same applies to the creation of Level&#160;2 models: with the plugin-oriented libSBML, applications normally would have to take deliberate steps to activate package code, instantiate objects, manage namespaces, and so on. LibSBML again loads the Layout package plugin automatically when creating a Level&#160;2 model, thereby making the APIs available to legacy applications without further work on their part. </p>
