\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s {\itshape S\+Base} class, base class of most S\+B\+ML objects.

Most components in S\+B\+ML are derived from a single abstract base type, \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}. In addition to serving as the parent class for most other classes of objects in S\+B\+ML, this base type is designed to allow a modeler or a software package to attach arbitrary information to each major element or list in an S\+B\+ML model.

\hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} has an optional subelement called \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{}. It is intended to serve as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by humans. An example use of the \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} element would be to contain formatted user comments about the model element in which the \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} element is enclosed. There are certain conditions on the X\+H\+T\+ML content permitted inside the \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} element; please consult the \href{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications}{\tt S\+B\+ML specification document} corresponding to the S\+B\+ML Level and Version of your model for more information about the requirements for \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} content.

\hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} has another optional subelement called \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{}. Whereas the \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} element described above is a container for content to be shown directly to humans, the \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} element is a container for optional software-\/generated content {\itshape not} meant to be shown to humans. The element\textquotesingle{}s content type is \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#elemdecls}{\tt X\+ML type \char`\"{}any\char`\"{}}, allowing essentially arbitrary data content. S\+B\+ML places only a few restrictions on the organization of the content; these are intended to help software tools read and write the data as well as help reduce conflicts between annotations added by different tools. As is the case with \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{}, it is important to refer to the \href{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications}{\tt S\+B\+ML specification document} corresponding to the S\+B\+ML Level and Version of your model for more information about the requirements for \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} content.

It is worth pointing out that the \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} element in the definition of \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} exists in order that software developers may attach optional application-\/specific data to the elements in an S\+B\+ML model. However, it is important that this facility not be misused. In particular, it is {\itshape critical} that data essential to a model definition or that can be encoded in existing S\+B\+ML elements is {\itshape not} stored in \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{}. \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} values, functional dependencies between model elements, etc., should not be recorded as annotations. It is crucial to keep in mind the fact that data placed in annotations can be freely ignored by software applications. If such data affects the interpretation of a model, then software interoperability is greatly impeded.

S\+B\+ML Level 2 introduced an optional \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} attribute named \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} for supporting metadata annotations using R\+DF (\href{http://www.w3.org/RDF/}{\tt Resource Description Format}). The attribute value has the data type \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id}{\tt X\+ML ID}, the X\+ML identifier type, which means each \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} value must be globally unique within an S\+B\+ML file. (Importantly, this uniqueness criterion applies across any attribute with type \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id}{\tt X\+ML ID}, not just the \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} attribute used by S\+B\+ML---something to be aware of if your application-\/specific X\+ML content inside the \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} subelement happens to use \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id}{\tt X\+ML ID}.) The \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} value serves to identify a model component for purposes such as referencing that component from metadata placed within \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} subelements.

Beginning with S\+B\+ML Level 2 Version 3, \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} also has an optional attribute named \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} for supporting the use of the Systems Biology Ontology. In S\+B\+ML proper, the data type of the attribute is a string of the form \char`\"{}\+S\+B\+O\+:\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\char`\"{}, where \char`\"{}\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\char`\"{} is a seven digit integer number; lib\+S\+B\+ML simplifies the representation by only storing the \char`\"{}\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\char`\"{} integer portion. Thus, in lib\+S\+B\+ML, the \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} attribute on \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} has data type {\ttfamily int}, and \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} identifiers are stored simply as integers. (For convenience, \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} offers methods for returning both the integer form and a text-\/string form of the \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} identifier.) \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class of S\+B\+ML object derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} imposes its own requirements about the values permitted for \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{}. Please consult the S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 specification for more information about the use of \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} and the \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} attribute.

Finally, note that, in the list of methods on \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}, there is no public constructor because \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} is an abstract class. The constructors reside in the subclasses derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}.\hypertarget{class_s_base_sbase-miriam}{}\subsection{Standard format for annotations linking data resources}\label{class_s_base_sbase-miriam}
S\+B\+ML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4, and Level~3, define a proposed regular format for encoding two particular categories of annotations\+: (a) references to controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers which define and describe biological and biochemical entities in a model; and (b) descriptions of the provenance of a model, including its author(s) and modification history.
