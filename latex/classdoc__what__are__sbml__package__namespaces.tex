\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The package namespaces object used in this constructor is derived from a \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object, which encapsulates S\+B\+ML Level/\+Version/namespaces information. It is used to communicate the S\+B\+ML Level, Version, and package version and name information used in addition to S\+B\+ML Level~3 Core. A common approach to using lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} facilities is to create an package namespace object somewhere in a program once, then hand that object as needed to object constructors of that package that accept it as and argument, such as this one.
