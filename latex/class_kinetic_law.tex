\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} The rate expression for an S\+B\+ML reaction.

An object of class \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} is used to describe the rate at which the process defined by a given \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} takes place. \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} has subelements called \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} (for Math\+ML content) and \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Parameters\char`\"{} (of class \hyperlink{class_list_of_parameters}{List\+Of\+Parameters}), in addition to the attributes and subelements it inherits from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}.

\hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement for holding a Math\+ML formula (required through S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1, but optional as of S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2) defines the rate of the reaction. The formula may refer to other entities in a model as well as local parameter definitions within the scope of the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} (see below). It is important to keep in mind, however, that the only \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} identifiers that can be used in this formula are those declared in the lists of reactants, products and modifiers in the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} structure. (In other words, before a species can be referenced in the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}, it must be declared in one of those lists.)

\hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} provides a way to define {\itshape local} parameters whose identifiers can be used in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula of that \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} instance. Prior to S\+B\+ML Level~3, these parameter definitions are stored inside a \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Parameters\char`\"{} subelement containing \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} objects; in S\+B\+ML Level~3, this is achieved using a specialized object class called \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} and the containing subelement is called \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Local\+Parameters\char`\"{}. In both cases, the parameters so defined are only visible within the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} (or, as of S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, only visible within the parent \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}); they cannot be accessed outside. A local parameter within one reaction is not visible from within another reaction, nor is it visible to any other construct outside of the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} in which it is defined. In addition, another important feature is that if such a \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} (or in Level~3, \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter}) object has the same identifier as another object in the scope of the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}, the definition inside the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} takes precedence. In other words, within the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula, references to local parameter identifiers {\bfseries shadow any identical global identifiers}.

The values of local parameters defined within \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} objects cannot change. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, this quality is built into the \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} construct. In Level~2, where the same kind of \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} object class is used as for global parameters, the \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} objects\textquotesingle{} \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute must always have a value of {\ttfamily true} (either explicitly or left to its default value).\hypertarget{class_kinetic_law_shadowing-warning}{}\subsection{A warning about identifier shadowing}\label{class_kinetic_law_shadowing-warning}
A common misconception is that different classes of objects (e.\+g., species, compartments, parameters) in S\+B\+ML have different identifier scopes. They do not. The implication is that if a \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}\textquotesingle{}s local parameter definition uses an identifier identical to {\itshape any} other identifier defined in the model outside the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}, even if the other identifier does {\itshape not} belong to a parameter type of object, the local parameter\textquotesingle{}s identifier takes precedence within that \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula. It is not an error in S\+B\+ML for identifiers to shadow each other this way, but can lead to confusing and subtle errors.\hypertarget{class_kinetic_law_version-diffs}{}\subsection{S\+B\+M\+L Level/\+Version differences}\label{class_kinetic_law_version-diffs}
In S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~1, the S\+B\+ML specification included two additional attributes on \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} called \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{}. They were removed beginning with S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~2 because further research determined they introduced many problems. The most significant problem was that their use could easily lead to the creation of valid models whose reactions nevertheless could not be integrated into a system of equations without outside knowledge for converting the quantities used. Examination of real-\/life models revealed that a common reason for using \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} on \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} was to set the units of all reactions to the same set of substance units, something that is better achieved by using \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} to redefine {\ttfamily \char`\"{}substance\char`\"{}} for the whole \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}.

As mentioned above, in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Versions 2--4, local parameters are of class \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, the class of object is \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter}.

In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the scope of the \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} was expanded to the entire \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}, instead of just the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}. This introduced a single new restriction\+: an L3v2 \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} may not now shadow the {\ttfamily id} of any \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} referenced by a \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} in the same \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}. Other than that, there is no difference in any core construct. However, packages may take advantage of this new scope by adding elements to the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} that may now reference a \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} defined in the same \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}.
