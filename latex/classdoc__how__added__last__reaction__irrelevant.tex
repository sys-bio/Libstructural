\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The mechanism by which the last \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} object was created and added to this \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} is not significant. It could have been created in a variety of ways, for example using create\+Reaction(). If a \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} does not exist for this model, a new \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} is {\itshape not} created and {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL} is returned instead.
