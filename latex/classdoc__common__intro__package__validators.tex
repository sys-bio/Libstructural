\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML implements facilities for verifying that a given S\+B\+ML document is valid according to the S\+B\+ML specifications; it also exposes the validation interface so that user programs and S\+B\+ML Level~3 package authors may use the facilities to implement new validators. There are two main interfaces to lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s validation facilities, based on the classes \hyperlink{class_validator}{Validator} and \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator}.
