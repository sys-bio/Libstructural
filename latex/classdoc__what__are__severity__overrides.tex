\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The {\itshape severity override} mechanism in \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error_log}{X\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} is intended to help applications handle error conditions in ways that may be more convenient for those applications. It is possible to use the mechanism to override the severity code of errors logged by lib\+S\+B\+ML, and even to disable error logging completely. An override stays in effect until the override is changed again by the calling application.
