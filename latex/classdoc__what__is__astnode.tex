\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
An A\+ST {\itshape node} in lib\+S\+B\+ML is a recursive tree structure; each node has a type, a pointer to a value, and a list of children nodes. Each \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} node may have none, one, two, or more children depending on its type. There are node types to represent numbers (with subtypes to distinguish integer, real, and rational numbers), names (e.\+g., constants or variables), simple mathematical operators, logical or relational operators and functions. The following diagram illustrates an example of how the mathematical expression {\ttfamily \char`\"{}1 + 2\char`\"{}} is represented as an A\+ST with one {\itshape plus} node having two {\itshape integer} children nodes for the numbers {\ttfamily 1} and {\ttfamily 2}. The figure also shows the corresponding Math\+ML representation\+:

The following are other noteworthy points about the A\+ST representation in lib\+S\+B\+ML\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A numerical value represented in Math\+ML as a real number with an exponent is preserved as such in the A\+ST node representation, even if the number could be stored in a {\ttfamily double} data type. This is done so that when an S\+B\+ML model is read in and then written out again, the amount of change introduced by lib\+S\+B\+ML to the S\+B\+ML during the round-\/trip activity is minimized.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rational numbers are represented in an A\+ST node using separate numerator and denominator values. These can be retrieved using the methods A\+S\+T\+Node\+::get\+Numerator() and A\+S\+T\+Node\+::get\+Denominator().\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The children of an \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} are other \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} objects. The list of children is empty for nodes that are leaf elements, such as numbers. For nodes that are actually roots of expression subtrees, the list of children points to the parsed objects that make up the rest of the expression.\end{DoxyItemize}
For many applications, the details of A\+S\+Ts are irrelevant because lib\+S\+B\+ML provides text-\/string based translation functions such as \{formula\+To\+L3\+String, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\} and \{parse\+L3\+Formula, String\}. If you find the complexity of using the A\+ST representation of expressions too high for your purposes, perhaps the string-\/based functions will be more suitable.
