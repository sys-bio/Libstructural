\hypertarget{classdoc__summary__of__extension__classes_ext-classes}{}\subsection{Summary of lib\+S\+B\+M\+L package extension classes}\label{classdoc__summary__of__extension__classes_ext-classes}
Implementing support for a given S\+B\+ML Level~3 package means creating new S\+B\+ML component objects (some may be extensions of existing S\+B\+ML components and others may be entirely new ones), plugging those object implementations into lib\+S\+B\+ML, and finally, doing some additional chores to make everything work. Here is a summary of the support classes provided by the lib\+S\+B\+ML extension mechanism for accomplishing these tasks.\hypertarget{classdoc__summary__of__extension__classes_ext-to-be-extended}{}\subsubsection{Classes to be extended}\label{classdoc__summary__of__extension__classes_ext-to-be-extended}
The following are the classes that typically need to be extended by creating subclasses specific to a given package extension\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension}\+: For each extension, a subclass of this class is used to implement methodality related to the package extension itself, such as the version(s) of the S\+B\+ML package it supports. This class provides methods for getting common attributes of package extension, and methods for initializing and registering the package when the package code is loaded into lib\+S\+B\+ML.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin}{S\+Base\+Plugin}\+: This is the base class of extensions to existing S\+B\+ML objects derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}. A typical package extension will derive multiple classes from \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin}{S\+Base\+Plugin}, each one extending a different S\+B\+ML object with new features defined by the package. For a given extended S\+B\+ML object, the derived class will typically be designed to contain additional attributes and/or subobjects of an S\+B\+ML package, and it will provide methods for accessing the additional attributes and/or elements.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document_plugin}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+Plugin}\+: This is a base class that a package implementation can either use directly if it adds no attribute other than the \char`\"{}required\char`\"{} attribute to the {\ttfamily $<$sbml$>$} element, or else must subclass if the S\+B\+ML package defines more attributes.\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{classdoc__summary__of__extension__classes_ext-to-be-instantiated}{}\subsubsection{Classes to be instantiated}\label{classdoc__summary__of__extension__classes_ext-to-be-instantiated}
Some classes in the lib\+S\+B\+ML package extension facilities are not meant to be subclassed, but rather are designed to be instantiated.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin_creator}{S\+Base\+Plugin\+Creator}\+: This is a template class used to create factory objects that in turn construct new instances of package plugin objects when necessary. These factory objects are invoked when, for example, lib\+S\+B\+ML encounters an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package in an S\+B\+ML document and needs to activate the corresponding lib\+S\+B\+ML package extension. Package implementations need to use \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin_creator}{S\+Base\+Plugin\+Creator} to create factory objects for each class derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin}{S\+Base\+Plugin}, and then they have to register these factory objects with the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension} derived class for the package extension.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Namespaces}\+: This is a template class; it is itself an extension of \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces}, and adds information specific to each package implementation. The resulting namespace object is used when creating package objects extended from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}. Each lib\+S\+B\+ML package extension must define its own variant using the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Namespaces} template class.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_register}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Register}\+: This is a registration template class. It is used by package extensions to register themselves with the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_registry}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Registry} (see below) when lib\+S\+B\+ML starts up. An instance of this class needs to be created by each package extension and used in a call to a method on \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_registry}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Registry}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{classdoc__summary__of__extension__classes_ext-additional-helpers}{}\subsubsection{Additional helper classes}\label{classdoc__summary__of__extension__classes_ext-additional-helpers}
The following additional classes do not need to be extended or instantiated; rather, they need to be called by other parts of a package implementation to accomplish bookkeeping or other tasks necessary to make the extension work in lib\+S\+B\+ML\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{S\+Base\+Extension\+Point}\+: This class is used as part of the mechanism that connects plugin objects (implemented using \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin}{S\+Base\+Plugin} or \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document_plugin}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+Plugin}) to a package extension. For instance, an implementation of an extended version of \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} (e.\+g., Layout\+Model\+Plugin in the Layout package) would involve the creation of an extension point using \hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{S\+Base\+Extension\+Point} and a mediator object created with \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin_creator}{S\+Base\+Plugin\+Creator}, to \char`\"{}plug\char`\"{} the extended \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object (Layout\+Model\+Plugin) into the overall Layout\+Extension object.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_registry}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Registry}\+: This class provides a central registry of all extensions known to lib\+S\+B\+ML. Each package extension is registered with the registry. The registry class is accessed by various classes to retrieve information about known package extensions and to create additional attributes and/or elements by factory objects of the package extensions. Lib\+S\+B\+ML cannot parse package extensions which are not registered with the registry.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_exception}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Exception}\+: As its name implies, this is an exception class. It is the class of exceptions thrown when package extensions encounter exceptions. \end{DoxyItemize}
