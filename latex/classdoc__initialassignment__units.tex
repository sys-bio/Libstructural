\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The units are calculated based on the mathematical expression in the \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} and the model quantities referenced by {\ttfamily $<$ci$>$} elements used within that expression. The method Initial\+Assignment\+::get\+Derived\+Unit\+Definition() returns the calculated units, to the extent that lib\+S\+B\+ML can compute them.
