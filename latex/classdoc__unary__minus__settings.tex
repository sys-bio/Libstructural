{\ttfamily \#include $<$L3\+Parser\+Settings.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This setting affects two behaviors. First, pairs of multiple unary minuses in a row (e.\+g., "{\ttfamily -\/ -\/3}") can be collapsed and ignored in the input, or the multiple minuses can be preserved in the A\+ST node tree that is generated by the parser. Second, minus signs in front of numbers can be collapsed into the number node itself; for example, a "{\ttfamily -\/ 4.\+1}" can be turned into a single \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} of type \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+R\+E\+AL,A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\} with a value of {\ttfamily -\/4.\+1}, or it can be turned into a node of type \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+M\+I\+N\+US,A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\} having a child node of type \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+R\+E\+AL,A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}.
