This file contains no code; it simply defines text fragments used as common documentation blocks in other lib\+S\+B\+ML files via the @copydetails operator from Doxygen. The use of @class is a hack needed because Doxygen\textquotesingle{}s @copydetails command has limited functionality. No classes are actually defined, and symbols beginning with \char`\"{}doc\+\_\+\char`\"{} are marked as ignored in our Doxygen configuration.
