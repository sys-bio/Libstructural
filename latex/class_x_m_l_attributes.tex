\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} A list of attributes on an X\+ML element.



In lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s X\+ML interface layer, attributes on an element are stored as a list of values kept in an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} object. \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} has methods for adding and removing individual attributes as well as performing other actions on the list of attributes. Classes in lib\+S\+B\+ML that represent nodes in an X\+ML document (i.\+e., \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} and its parent class, \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token}) use \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} objects to manage attributes on X\+ML elements.

Attributes on an X\+ML element can be written in one of two forms\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily name=\char`\"{}value\char`\"{}} \item {\ttfamily prefix\+:name=\char`\"{}value\char`\"{}}\end{DoxyItemize}
An attribute in X\+ML must always have a value, and the value must always be a quoted string; i.\+e., it is always {\ttfamily name=\char`\"{}value\char`\"{}} and not {\ttfamily name=value}. An empty value is represented simply as an empty string; i.\+e., {\ttfamily name=\char`\"{}\char`\"{}}.

In cases when a {\ttfamily prefix} is provided with an attribute name, general X\+ML validity rules require that the prefix is an X\+ML namespace prefix that has been declared somewhere else (possibly as an another attribute on the same element). However, the \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} class does {\itshape not} test for the proper existence or declaration of X\+ML namespaces---callers must arrange to do this themselves in some other way. This class only provides facilities for tracking and manipulating attributes and their prefix/\+U\+R\+I/name/value components.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Note that although \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} provides operations that can manipulate attributes based on a numerical index, X\+ML attributes are in fact unordered when they appear in files and data streams. The \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} class provides some list-\/like facilities, but it is only for the convenience of callers. (For example, it permits callers to loop across all attributes more easily.) Users should keep in mind that the order in which attributes are stored in \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} objects has no real impact on the order in which the attributes are read or written from an X\+ML file or data stream.
