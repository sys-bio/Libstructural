\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The text-\/string form of mathematical formulas produced by \{formula\+To\+String, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\} and read by \{parse\+Formula, String\} use a simple C-\/inspired infix notation taken from S\+B\+ML Level~1. A formula in this text-\/string form therefore can be handed to a program that understands S\+B\+ML Level~1 mathematical expressions, or used as part of a formula translation system. The syntax is described in detail in the documentation for \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}. The following are illustrative examples of formulas expressed using this syntax\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}0.10 * k4^2
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \begin{DoxyVerb}(vm * s1)/(km + s1)
\end{DoxyVerb}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
Note that this facility is provided as a convenience by lib\+S\+B\+ML---the Math\+ML standard does not actually define a \char`\"{}string-\/form\char`\"{} equivalent to Math\+ML expression trees, so the choice of formula syntax is somewhat arbitrary. The approach taken by lib\+S\+B\+ML is to use the syntax defined by S\+B\+ML Level~1 (which in fact used a text-\/string representation of formulas and not Math\+ML). This formula syntax is based mostly on C programming syntax, and may contain operators, function calls, symbols, and white space characters. The following table provides the precedence rules for the different entities that may appear in formula strings.



In the table above, {\itshape operand} implies the construct is an operand, {\itshape prefix} implies the operation is applied to the following arguments, {\itshape unary} implies there is one argument, and {\itshape binary} implies there are two arguments. The values in the {\bfseries Precedence} column show how the order of different types of operation are determined. For example, the expression {\ttfamily a $\ast$ b + c} is evaluated as {\ttfamily (a $\ast$ b) + c} because the {\ttfamily $\ast$} operator has higher precedence. The {\bfseries Associates} column shows how the order of similar precedence operations is determined; for example, {\ttfamily a -\/ b + c} is evaluated as {\ttfamily (a -\/ b) + c} because the {\ttfamily +} and {\ttfamily -\/} operators are left-\/associative.

The function call syntax consists of a function name, followed by optional white space, followed by an opening parenthesis token, followed by a sequence of zero or more arguments separated by commas (with each comma optionally preceded and/or followed by zero or more white space characters, followed by a closing parenthesis token. The function name must be chosen from one of the pre-\/defined functions in S\+B\+ML or a user-\/defined function in the model. The following table lists the names of certain common mathematical functions; this table corresponds to Table~6 in the \href{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications#SBML_Level_1_Version_2}{\tt S\+B\+ML Level~1 Version~2 specification}\+:



\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
There are differences between the symbols used to represent the common mathematical functions and the corresponding Math\+ML token names. This is a potential source of incompatibilities. Note in particular that in this text-\/string syntax, {\ttfamily log(x)} represents the natural logarithm, whereas in Math\+ML, the natural logarithm is {\ttfamily $<$ln/$>$}. Application writers are urged to be careful when translating between text forms and Math\+ML forms, especially if they provide a direct text-\/string input facility to users of their software systems.
