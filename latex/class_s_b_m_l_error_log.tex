\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Log of diagnostics reported during processing.



The error log is a list. Each \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} maintains its own \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log}. When a lib\+S\+B\+ML operation on S\+B\+ML content results in an error, or when there is something worth noting about the S\+B\+ML content, the issue is reported as an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} object stored in the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} list.

\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} is derived from \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error_log}{X\+M\+L\+Error\+Log}, an object class that serves exactly the same purpose but for the X\+ML parsing layer. \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error_log}{X\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} provides crucial methods such as get\+Num\+Errors() for determining how many \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} or \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} objects are in the log. \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} inherits these methods.

The general approach to working with \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} in user programs involves first obtaining a pointer to a log from a lib\+S\+B\+ML object such as \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document}. Callers should then use get\+Num\+Errors() to inquire how many objects there are in the list. (The answer may be 0.) If there is at least one \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} object in the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} instance, callers can then iterate over the list using S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log\+::get\+Error(), using methods provided by the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} class to find out the error code and associated information such as the error severity, the message, and the line number in the input.

If you wish to simply print the error strings for a human to read, an easier and more direct way might be to use S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::print\+Errors().
