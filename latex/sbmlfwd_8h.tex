Put another way, the type definitions below serve the same purpose as {\ttfamily class Foo;} forward declarations in C++ code.

\{core\} An S\+B\+ML {\itshape algebraic rule} representing {\itshape 0 = f({\bfseries W})}.

The rule type \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} is derived from the parent class \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule}. It is used to express equations that are neither assignments of model variables nor rates of change. \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} does not add any attributes to the basic \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule}; its role is simply to distinguish this case from the other cases.

In the context of a simulation, algebraic rules are in effect at all times, {\itshape t} $\geq$ {\itshape 0}. For purposes of evaluating expressions that involve the delay \char`\"{}csymbol\char`\"{} (see the S\+B\+ML specification), algebraic rules are considered to apply also at {\itshape t} $\leq$ {\itshape 0}. Please consult the relevant S\+B\+ML specification for additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time {\itshape t} $\leq$ {\itshape 0}.

An S\+B\+ML model must not be overdetermined. The ability to define arbitrary algebraic expressions in an S\+B\+ML model introduces the possibility that a model is mathematically overdetermined by the overall system of equations constructed from its rules, reactions and events. Therefore, if an algebraic rule is introduced in a model, for at least one of the entities referenced in the rule\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} element the value of that entity must not be completely determined by other constructs in the model. This means that at least this entity must not have the attribute \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{}={\ttfamily true} and there must also not be a rate rule or assignment rule for it. Furthermore, if the entity is a \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object, its value must not be determined by reactions, which means that it must either have the attribute \char`\"{}boundary\+Condition\char`\"{}={\ttfamily true} or else not be involved in any reaction at all. These restrictions are explained in more detail in the S\+B\+ML specification documents.

In S\+B\+ML Levels 2 and~3, \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} object identifiers can be referenced in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expression of an algebraic rule, but reaction rates can never be {\itshape determined} by algebraic rules. This is true even when a reaction does not contain a \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object. (In such cases of missing kinetic law definitions, the model is valid but incomplete; the rates of reactions lacking kinetic laws are simply undefined, and not determined by the algebraic rule.)

Finally, any symbol that appears as the target of a rate\+Of csymbol (\{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+F\+U\+N\+C\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+OF, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2) may not be determined by an \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}. This is because the rate\+Of csymbol is defined as applying only to symbols whose rates of change are easily determinable.

Users should note that these rules about what symbols may not be determined by an \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} may be used to discover what symbol is being determined by an \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}. If three symbols appear in the math element of an \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}, the first of which is flagged constant={\ttfamily true}, and the second of which appears as the target of a rate\+Of csymbol, one may conclude that the \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} must be used to determine the value of the third symbol. This is, in fact, a principle use (outside of validation) of the constant attribute\+: its use in allowing software to properly identify the dependent variable in an \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-general}{}\subsection{General summary of S\+B\+M\+L rules}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-general}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3 as well as Level~2, rules are separated into three subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software. The three subclasses are based on the following three different possible functional forms (where {\itshape x} is a variable, {\itshape f} is some arbitrary function returning a numerical result, {\bfseries {\itshape V}} is a vector of variables that does not include {\itshape x}, and {\bfseries {\itshape W}} is a vector of variables that may include {\itshape x})\+:

\tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu} spread 0pt [c]{*{3}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
{\itshape Algebraic\+:}&left-\/hand side is zero&{\itshape 0 = f({\bfseries W})} \\\cline{1-3}
{\itshape Assignment\+:}&left-\/hand side is a scalar\+:&{\itshape x = f({\bfseries V})} \\\cline{1-3}
{\itshape Rate\+:}&left-\/hand side is a rate-\/of-\/change\+:&{\itshape dx/dt = f({\bfseries W})} \\\cline{1-3}
\end{longtabu}


In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish between {\itshape assignment} and {\itshape algebraic} rules. They are treated as separate cases for the following reasons\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Assignment} rules can simply be evaluated to calculate intermediate values for use in numerical methods. They are statements of equality that hold at all times. (For assignments that are only performed once, see \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}.)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+B\+ML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of general algebraic equations;\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Those simulators that {\itshape can} solve these algebraic equations make a distinction between the different categories listed above; and\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable to models that do not contain {\itshape algebraic} rules.\end{DoxyItemize}
The approach taken to covering these cases in S\+B\+ML is to define an abstract \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} structure containing a subelement, \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}, to hold the right-\/hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} that add attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate rules. The \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement must contain a Math\+ML expression defining the mathematical formula of the rule. This Math\+ML formula must return a numerical value. The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the variables and other entities in an S\+B\+ML model.

Each of the three subclasses of \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} (\hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule}) inherit the the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement and other fields from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}. The \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} classes add an additional attribute, \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}. See the definitions of \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-restrictions}{}\subsection{Additional restrictions on S\+B\+M\+L rules}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-restrictions}
An important design goal of S\+B\+ML rule semantics is to ensure that a model\textquotesingle{}s simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or how often rules are evaluated. To achieve this, S\+B\+ML needs to place two restrictions on rule use. The first concerns algebraic loops in the system of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-no-loops}{}\subsubsection{A model must not contain algebraic loops}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-no-loops}
The combined set of \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be considered as a whole. (A \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object is counted as an assignment because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attribute of the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} object in which it is defined.) This combined set of assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate. To put this more formally, consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an S\+B\+ML species, compartment or parameter symbol in an assignment statement\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement. Let the directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the statements that contain the symbol in their \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement expressions. This graph must be acyclic.

Similarly, the combined set of \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} objects constitute a set of definitions for the rates of change of various model entities (namely, the objects identified by the values of the \textquotesingle{}variable\textquotesingle{} attributes of the \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} objects, and the \textquotesingle{}species\textquotesingle{} attributes of the \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} objects in each \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}). In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, these rates of change may be referenced directly using the {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol, but may not thereby contain algebraic loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate. More formally, consider a directed graph in which the nodes are the definitions of different variables\textquotesingle{} rates of change, and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of a variable referenced by a {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol from any \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object in the model. Let the directed arcs point from the variable referenced by the {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol (call it {\itshape x}) to the variable(s) determined by the \textquotesingle{}math\textquotesingle{} expression in which {\itshape x} appears. This graph must be acyclic.

S\+B\+ML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated. Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations changing. As an example, consider the set of equations {\itshape x = x + 1}, {\itshape y = z + 200} and {\itshape z = y + 100}. If this set of equations were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid because the rule for {\itshape x} refers to {\itshape x} (exhibiting one type of loop), and the rule for {\itshape y} refers to {\itshape z} while the rule for {\itshape z} refers back to {\itshape y} (exhibiting another type of loop). Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of assignment statements\+: {\itshape x = 10}, {\itshape y = z + 200}, and {\itshape z = x
\begin{DoxyItemize}

{\itshape  An S\+B\+ML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not define more equations than there are unknowns in a model. A valid S\+B\+ML model that does not contain \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} structures cannot be overdetermined.}

{\itshape  Lib\+S\+B\+ML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix~B of the S\+B\+ML Level~3 specification for assessing whether a model is overdetermined.}

{\itshape  (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic, mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model. One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the equations. Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system are linked to the equations that determine them. For algebraic equations, there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the equation. For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that differential equation. A mathematical model is overdetermined if the maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes representing equations. If one maximal matching has this property, then all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.\+e., it is only necessary to find one maximal matching.)}

\{core\} An S\+B\+ML {\itshape assignment rule} representing {\itshape x = f({\bfseries Y})}.

The rule type \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} is derived from the parent class \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule}. It is used to express equations that set the values of variables. The left-\/hand side (the attribute named \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}) of an assignment rule must refer to the identifier of a \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} (in S\+B\+ML Level~3), \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, or global \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} object in the model (but not a \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}). In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, it may also refer to the S\+Id of an element defined in an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package with mathematical meaning and the ability to be assigned. The entity identified must have its \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute set to {\ttfamily false}. The effects of an assignment rule construct are in general terms the same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type of S\+B\+ML component being set\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape In the case of a species}, an S\+B\+ML assignment rule sets the referenced species\textquotesingle{} quantity (whether a \char`\"{}concentration\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}amount\char`\"{}) to the value determined by the formula in the Math\+ML subelement \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. The unit associated with the value produced by the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula {\itshape should} (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in S\+B\+ML Level~3) or {\itshape must} (in S\+B\+ML releases prior to Level~2 version~4) be equal to the unit associated with the species\textquotesingle{} quantity. {\itshape Restrictions}\+: There must not be both an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute and a \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} \char`\"{}species\char`\"{} attribute having the same value in a model, unless the referenced \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object has its \char`\"{}boundary\+Condition\char`\"{} attribute set to {\ttfamily true}. In other words, an assignment rule cannot be defined for a species that is created or destroyed in a reaction unless that species is defined as a boundary condition in the model.


\item (For S\+B\+ML Level~3 only) {\itshape In the case of a species reference}, an assignment rule sets the stoichiometry of the referenced reactant or product to the value determined by the formula in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. The unit associated with the value produced by the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula should be consistent with the unit \char`\"{}dimensionless\char`\"{}, because reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless quantities.


\item {\itshape In the case of a compartment}, an S\+B\+ML assignment rule sets the referenced compartment\textquotesingle{}s size to the value determined by the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement of the \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} object. The overall units of the formula in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} {\itshape should} (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in S\+B\+ML Level~3) or {\itshape must} (in S\+B\+ML releases prior to Level~2 version~4) be the same as the units of the size of the compartment.


\item {\itshape In the case of a parameter}, an assignment rule sets the referenced parameter\textquotesingle{}s value to that determined by the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement of the \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} object. The overall units of the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement {\itshape should} (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in S\+B\+ML Level~3) or {\itshape must} (in S\+B\+ML releases prior to Level~2 version~4) be the same as the units defined for the parameter.


\item (For S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2 only) {\itshape In the case of an object from an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package}, an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} sets the referenced object\textquotesingle{}s value (as defined by that package) to the value of the formula in math. The unit of measurement associated with the value produced by the formula should be the same as that object\textquotesingle{}s units attribute value (if it has such an attribute), or be equal to the units of model components of that type (if objects of that class are defined by the package as having the same units).


\end{DoxyItemize}

In S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3 Version~1, the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement of the \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} is required. In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, this rule is relaxed, and the subelement is optional. If an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} with no \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} child is present in the model, the value of its referenced \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} is undefined. This may represent a situation where the model itself is unfinished, or the missing information may be provided by an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package.

If the variable attribute of an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} object references an object in an S\+B\+ML namespace not understood by the interpreter reading a given S\+B\+ML document (that is, if the object is defined by an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package that the software does not support), the assignment rule must be ignored--the object\textquotesingle{}s value will not need to be set, as the interpreter could not understand that package. If an interpreter cannot establish whether a referenced object is missing from the model or instead is defined in an S\+B\+ML namespace not understood by the interpreter, it may produce a warning to the user. (The latter situation may only arise if an S\+B\+ML package is present in the S\+B\+ML document with a package\+:required attribute of \char`\"{}true\char`\"{}.)

In the context of a simulation, assignment rules are in effect at all times, {\itshape t} $\geq$ {\itshape 0}. For purposes of evaluating expressions that involve the {\itshape delay} \char`\"{}csymbol\char`\"{} (see the S\+B\+ML Level~2 specification), assignment rules are considered to apply also at {\itshape t} $\leq$ {\itshape 0}. Please consult the relevant S\+B\+ML specification for additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time {\itshape t} $\leq$ {\itshape 0}.

A model must not contain more than one \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} object having the same value of \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}; in other words, in the set of all assignment rules and rate rules in an S\+B\+ML model, each variable appearing in the left-\/hand sides can only appear once. This simply follows from the fact that an indeterminate system would result if a model contained more than one assignment rule for the same variable or both an assignment rule and a rate rule for the same variable.

Similarly, a model must also not contain {\itshape both} an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} definition for the same variable, because both kinds of constructs apply prior to and at the start of simulation time, i.\+e., {\itshape t} $\leq$ {\itshape 0}. If a model contained both an initial assignment and an assignment rule for the same variable, an indeterminate system would result.

The value calculated by an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} object overrides the value assigned to the given symbol by the model component defining that symbol. For example, if a \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} attribute value is set in its definition, and the model also contains an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} object having that compartment\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} as its \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} value, then the \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} assigned in the \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object definition is ignored and the value assigned based on the computation defined in the \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}. This does {\itshape not} mean that a definition for a given symbol can be omitted if there is an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} object involving it. For example, there must be a \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} object definition for a given parameter if there is an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} definition for that parameter. It is only a question of which value definition takes precedence.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-general}{}\subsection{General summary of S\+B\+M\+L rules}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-general}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3 as well as Level~2, rules are separated into three subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software. The three subclasses are based on the following three different possible functional forms (where {\itshape x} is a variable, {\itshape f} is some arbitrary function returning a numerical result, {\bfseries {\itshape V}} is a vector of variables that does not include {\itshape x}, and {\bfseries {\itshape W}} is a vector of variables that may include {\itshape x})\+:

\tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu} spread 0pt [c]{*{3}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
{\itshape Algebraic\+:}&left-\/hand side is zero&{\itshape 0 = f({\bfseries W})} \\\cline{1-3}
{\itshape Assignment\+:}&left-\/hand side is a scalar\+:&{\itshape x = f({\bfseries V})} \\\cline{1-3}
{\itshape Rate\+:}&left-\/hand side is a rate-\/of-\/change\+:&{\itshape dx/dt = f({\bfseries W})} \\\cline{1-3}
\end{longtabu}


In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish between {\itshape assignment} and {\itshape algebraic} rules. They are treated as separate cases for the following reasons\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Assignment} rules can simply be evaluated to calculate intermediate values for use in numerical methods. They are statements of equality that hold at all times. (For assignments that are only performed once, see \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}.)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+B\+ML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of general algebraic equations;\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Those simulators that {\itshape can} solve these algebraic equations make a distinction between the different categories listed above; and\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable to models that do not contain {\itshape algebraic} rules.\end{DoxyItemize}
The approach taken to covering these cases in S\+B\+ML is to define an abstract \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} structure containing a subelement, \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}, to hold the right-\/hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} that add attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate rules. The \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement must contain a Math\+ML expression defining the mathematical formula of the rule. This Math\+ML formula must return a numerical value. The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the variables and other entities in an S\+B\+ML model.

Each of the three subclasses of \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} (\hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule}) inherit the the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement and other fields from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}. The \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} classes add an additional attribute, \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}. See the definitions of \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-restrictions}{}\subsection{Additional restrictions on S\+B\+M\+L rules}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-restrictions}
An important design goal of S\+B\+ML rule semantics is to ensure that a model\textquotesingle{}s simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or how often rules are evaluated. To achieve this, S\+B\+ML needs to place two restrictions on rule use. The first concerns algebraic loops in the system of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-no-loops}{}\subsubsection{A model must not contain algebraic loops}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-no-loops}
The combined set of \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be considered as a whole. (A \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object is counted as an assignment because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attribute of the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} object in which it is defined.) This combined set of assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate. To put this more formally, consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an S\+B\+ML species, compartment or parameter symbol in an assignment statement\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement. Let the directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the statements that contain the symbol in their \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement expressions. This graph must be acyclic.

Similarly, the combined set of \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} objects constitute a set of definitions for the rates of change of various model entities (namely, the objects identified by the values of the \textquotesingle{}variable\textquotesingle{} attributes of the \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} objects, and the \textquotesingle{}species\textquotesingle{} attributes of the \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} objects in each \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}). In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, these rates of change may be referenced directly using the {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol, but may not thereby contain algebraic loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate. More formally, consider a directed graph in which the nodes are the definitions of different variables\textquotesingle{} rates of change, and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of a variable referenced by a {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol from any \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object in the model. Let the directed arcs point from the variable referenced by the {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol (call it {\itshape x}) to the variable(s) determined by the \textquotesingle{}math\textquotesingle{} expression in which {\itshape x} appears. This graph must be acyclic.

S\+B\+ML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated. Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations changing. As an example, consider the set of equations {\itshape x = x + 1}, {\itshape y = z + 200} and {\itshape z = y + 100}. If this set of equations were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid because the rule for {\itshape x} refers to {\itshape x} (exhibiting one type of loop), and the rule for {\itshape y} refers to {\itshape z} while the rule for {\itshape z} refers back to {\itshape y} (exhibiting another type of loop). Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of assignment statements\+: {\itshape x = 10}, {\itshape y = z + 200}, and {\itshape z = x
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 100.

{\itshape  An S\+B\+ML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not define more equations than there are unknowns in a model. A valid S\+B\+ML model that does not contain \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} structures cannot be overdetermined.}

{\itshape  Lib\+S\+B\+ML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix~B of the S\+B\+ML Level~3 specification for assessing whether a model is overdetermined.}

{\itshape  (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic, mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model. One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the equations. Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system are linked to the equations that determine them. For algebraic equations, there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the equation. For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that differential equation. A mathematical model is overdetermined if the maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes representing equations. If one maximal matching has this property, then all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.\+e., it is only necessary to find one maximal matching.)}

\{core\} Abstract Syntax Trees for mathematical expressions.



\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree}{\tt Abstract Syntax Trees} (A\+S\+Ts) are a simple kind of data structure used in lib\+S\+B\+ML for storing mathematical expressions. Lib\+S\+B\+ML A\+S\+Ts provide a canonical, in-\/memory representation for all mathematical formulas regardless of their original format (which might be Math\+ML or might be text strings).

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
An A\+ST {\itshape node} in lib\+S\+B\+ML is a recursive tree structure; each node has a type, a pointer to a value, and a list of children nodes. Each \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} node may have none, one, two, or more children depending on its type. There are node types to represent numbers (with subtypes to distinguish integer, real, and rational numbers), names (e.\+g., constants or variables), simple mathematical operators, logical or relational operators and functions. The following diagram illustrates an example of how the mathematical expression {\ttfamily \char`\"{}1 + 2\char`\"{}} is represented as an A\+ST with one {\itshape plus} node having two {\itshape integer} children nodes for the numbers {\ttfamily 1} and {\ttfamily 2}. The figure also shows the corresponding Math\+ML representation\+:
\end{DoxyParagraph}


The following are other noteworthy points about the A\+ST representation in lib\+S\+B\+ML\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A numerical value represented in Math\+ML as a real number with an exponent is preserved as such in the A\+ST node representation, even if the number could be stored in a {\ttfamily double} data type. This is done so that when an S\+B\+ML model is read in and then written out again, the amount of change introduced by lib\+S\+B\+ML to the S\+B\+ML during the round-\/trip activity is minimized.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Rational numbers are represented in an A\+ST node using separate numerator and denominator values. These can be retrieved using the methods A\+S\+T\+Node\+::get\+Numerator() and A\+S\+T\+Node\+::get\+Denominator().\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The children of an \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} are other \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} objects. The list of children is empty for nodes that are leaf elements, such as numbers. For nodes that are actually roots of expression subtrees, the list of children points to the parsed objects that make up the rest of the expression.\end{DoxyItemize}
For many applications, the details of A\+S\+Ts are irrelevant because lib\+S\+B\+ML provides text-\/string based translation functions such as \{formula\+To\+L3\+String, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\} and \{parse\+L3\+Formula, String\}. If you find the complexity of using the A\+ST representation of expressions too high for your purposes, perhaps the string-\/based functions will be more suitable.

\paragraph*{\label{_ASTNodeType_t}%
The set of possible A\+S\+T\+Node types}

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Every \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} has an associated type code to indicate whether, for example, it holds a number or stands for an arithmetic operator.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
The list of possible types is quite long, because it covers all the mathematical functions that are permitted in S\+B\+ML. The values are shown in the following table\+:



The types have the following meanings\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the node is basic mathematical operator (e.\+g., {\ttfamily \char`\"{}+\char`\"{}}), then the node\textquotesingle{}s type will be \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+P\+L\+US,A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+M\+I\+N\+US, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+T\+I\+M\+ES, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+D\+I\+V\+I\+DE, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, or \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+P\+O\+W\+ER, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, as appropriate.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the node is a predefined function or operator from S\+B\+ML Level~1 (in the string-\/based formula syntax used in Level~1) or S\+B\+ML Level~2 and~3 (in the subset of Math\+ML used in S\+B\+ML Levels~2 and~3), then the node\textquotesingle{}s type will be either {\ttfamily A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+F\+U\+N\+C\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+}X, {\ttfamily A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+L\+O\+G\+I\+C\+A\+L\+\_\+}X, or {\ttfamily A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+R\+E\+L\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+A\+L\+\_\+}X, as appropriate. (Examples\+: \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+F\+U\+N\+C\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+L\+OG, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+R\+E\+L\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+A\+L\+\_\+\+L\+EQ, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}.)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the node refers to a user-\/defined function, the node\textquotesingle{}s type will be \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+F\+U\+N\+C\+T\+I\+ON, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\} (because it holds the name of the function).\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the node is a lambda expression, its type will be \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+L\+A\+M\+B\+DA, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the node is a predefined constant ({\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Exponential\+E\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Pi\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+True\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+False\char`\"{}}), then the node\textquotesingle{}s type will be \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+S\+T\+A\+N\+T\+\_\+E, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+S\+T\+A\+N\+T\+\_\+\+PI, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+S\+T\+A\+N\+T\+\_\+\+T\+R\+UE, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, or \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+S\+T\+A\+N\+T\+\_\+\+F\+A\+L\+SE, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (Levels~2 and~3 only) If the node is the special Math\+ML csymbol {\ttfamily time}, the value of the node will be \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+M\+E\+\_\+\+T\+I\+ME, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}. (Note, however, that the Math\+ML csymbol {\ttfamily delay} is translated into a node of type \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+F\+U\+N\+C\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+D\+E\+L\+AY, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}. The difference is due to the fact that {\ttfamily time} is a single variable, whereas {\ttfamily delay} is actually a function taking arguments.)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (Level~3 only) If the node is the special Math\+ML csymbol {\ttfamily avogadro}, the value of the node will be \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+M\+E\+\_\+\+A\+V\+O\+G\+A\+D\+RO, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (Level~3 Version~2+ only) If the node is the special Math\+ML csymbol {\ttfamily rate\+Of}, the value of the node will be \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+F\+U\+N\+C\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+R\+A\+T\+E\+\_\+\+OF, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (Level~3 Version~2+ only) If the node is a Math\+ML operator that originates in a package, and is not defined in S\+B\+ML Leve~3 core, the value of the node will be \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+O\+R\+I\+G\+I\+N\+A\+T\+E\+S\+\_\+\+I\+N\+\_\+\+P\+A\+C\+K\+A\+GE, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the node contains a numerical value, its type will be \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+I\+N\+T\+E\+G\+ER, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+R\+E\+AL, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+R\+E\+A\+L\+\_\+E, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, or \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+R\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+AL, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}, as appropriate.\end{DoxyItemize}
\paragraph*{\label{_math-convert}%
Converting between A\+S\+Ts and text strings}

The text-\/string form of mathematical formulas produced by \{formula\+To\+String, String\} and \{formula\+To\+L3\+String, String\}, and read by \{parse\+Formula, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\} and \{parse\+L3\+Formula, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\}, are in a simple C-\/inspired infix notation. A formula in one of these two text-\/string formats can be handed to a program that understands S\+B\+ML mathematical expressions, or used as part of a translation system. The lib\+S\+B\+ML distribution comes with example programs in the {\ttfamily \char`\"{}examples\char`\"{}} subdirectory that demonstrate such things as translating infix formulas into Math\+ML and vice-\/versa.

Please see the documentation for the functions \{parse\+Formula, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\} and \{parse\+L3\+Formula, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\} for detailed explanations of the infix syntax they accept.

\paragraph*{\label{_math-interpretation}%
Interpretation}

Proper mathematical interpretation of an \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} requires an understanding of all the allowed Math\+ML operators, the S\+B\+M\+L-\/specific csymbols, and of the named variables in the S\+B\+ML model. It is important to note that an invalid \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} might not have a proper mathematical interpretation--a \textquotesingle{}minus\textquotesingle{} node with three children is simply illegal, and cannot be interpreted. Similarly, a named variable that does not exist in the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} also cannot be interpreted. In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the ability was added to reference named variables in Math\+ML that might exist in S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages. This means that if the software reading the S\+B\+ML file (or this version of libsbml) does not understand that package, Math\+ML using named variables from those packages will be legal, but will not be interpretable. It is valid to issue a warning in this case, and may be otherwise handled as if an invalid variable name was used. In all cases, the \char`\"{}required\char`\"{} attribute for the package in question must be set to \char`\"{}true\char`\"{}.

\paragraph*{\label{_math-history}%
Historical notes}

Readers may wonder why this part of lib\+S\+B\+ML uses a seemingly less object-\/oriented design than other parts. Originally, much of lib\+S\+B\+ML was written in~C. All subsequent development was done in C++, but the complexity of some of the functionality for converting between infix, A\+ST and Math\+ML, coupled with the desire to maintain stability and backward compatibility, means that some of the underlying code is still written in~C. This has lead to the exposed A\+PI being more C-\/like.

\{core\} An S\+B\+ML compartment, where species are located.

A compartment in S\+B\+ML represents a bounded space in which species are located. Compartments do not necessarily have to correspond to actual structures inside or outside of a biological cell.

It is important to note that although compartments are optional in the overall definition of \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}, every species in an S\+B\+ML model must be located in a compartment. This in turn means that if a model defines any species, the model must also define at least one compartment. The reason is simply that species represent physical things, and therefore must exist {\itshape somewhere}. Compartments represent the {\itshape somewhere}.

\hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} has one required attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, to give the compartment a unique identifier by which other parts of an S\+B\+ML model definition can refer to it. A compartment can also have an optional \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute of type {\ttfamily string}. Identifiers and names must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specifications.

\hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} also has an optional attribute \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} that is used to indicate the number of spatial dimensions possessed by the compartment. Most modeling scenarios involve compartments with integer values of \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} of {\ttfamily 3} (i.\+e., a three-\/dimensional compartment, which is to say, a volume), or 2 (a two-\/dimensional compartment, a surface), or {\ttfamily 1} (a one-\/dimensional compartment, a line). In S\+B\+ML Level~3, the type of this attribute is {\ttfamily double}, there are no restrictions on the permitted values of the \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute, and there are no default values. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the value must be a positive {\ttfamily integer}, and the default value is {\ttfamily 3}; the permissible values in S\+B\+ML Level~2 are {\ttfamily 3}, {\ttfamily 2}, {\ttfamily 1}, and {\ttfamily 0} (for a point).

Another optional attribute on \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} is \char`\"{}size\char`\"{}, representing the {\itshape initial} total size of that compartment in the model. The \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} attribute must be a floating-\/point value and may represent a volume (if the compartment is a three-\/dimensional one), or an area (if the compartment is two-\/dimensional), or a length (if the compartment is one-\/dimensional). There is no default value of compartment size in S\+B\+ML Level~2 or Level~3. In particular, a missing \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} value {\itshape does not imply that the compartment size is 1}. (This is unlike the definition of compartment \char`\"{}volume\char`\"{} in S\+B\+ML Level~1.) When the compartment\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute does not have a value of {\ttfamily 0}, a missing value of \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} for a given compartment signifies that the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} object elsewhere in the model. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, there are additional special requirements on the values of \char`\"{}size\char`\"{}; we discuss them in a \href{#comp-l2}{\tt separate section below}.

The units associated with a compartment\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} attribute value may be set using the optional attribute \char`\"{}units\char`\"{}. The rules for setting and using compartment size units differ between S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3, and are discussed separately below.

Finally, the \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} attribute named \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} is used to indicate whether the compartment\textquotesingle{}s size stays constant after simulation begins. A value of {\ttfamily true} indicates the compartment\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} cannot be changed by any other construct except \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}; a value of {\ttfamily false} indicates the compartment\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} can be changed by other constructs in S\+B\+ML. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, there is an additional explicit restriction that if \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{}={\ttfamily \char`\"{}0\char`\"{}}, the value cannot be changed by \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} either. Further, in Level~2, \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} is optional, and has a default value of {\ttfamily true}. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, there is no default value for the \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute, and it is required.\hypertarget{class_compartment_comp-l2}{}\subsection{Additional considerations in S\+B\+M\+L Level 2}\label{class_compartment_comp-l2}
In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the default units of compartment size, and the kinds of units allowed as values of the attribute \char`\"{}units\char`\"{}, interact with the number of spatial dimensions of the compartment. The value of the \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute of a \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object must be one of the base units (see \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit}), or the predefined unit identifiers {\ttfamily volume}, {\ttfamily area}, {\ttfamily length} or {\ttfamily dimensionless}, or a new unit defined by a \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} object in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}, subject to the restrictions detailed in the following table\+:

In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the units of the compartment size, as defined by the \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute or (if \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} is not set) the default value listed in the table above, are used in the following ways when the compartment has a \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} value greater than {\ttfamily 0}\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The value of the \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute is used as the units of the compartment identifier when the identifier appears as a numerical quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in Math\+ML.


\item The {\ttfamily math} element of an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} referring to this compartment {\itshape must} (in Level~2 Versions~1-\/3) or {\itshape should} (in Level~2 Version 4) have identical units.


\item In \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} objects that set the rate of change of the compartment\textquotesingle{}s size, the units of the rule\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily math} element {\itshape must} (in Level~2 Versions~1--3) or {\itshape should} (in Level~2 Version 4) be identical to the compartment\textquotesingle{}s units (whether defined by the \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute or by taking the default value from the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}) divided by the default {\itshape time} units. (In other words, the units for the rate of change of compartment size are {\itshape compartment size}/{\itshape time} units.


\item When a \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} is to be treated in terms of concentrations or density, the units of the spatial size portion of the concentration value (i.\+e., the denominator in the units formula {\itshape substance/{\itshape size})} are those indicated by the value of the \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute on the compartment in which the species is located. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Compartments with \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{}={\ttfamily 0} require special treatment in this framework. As implied above, the \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} attribute must not have a value on an S\+B\+ML Level~2 \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object if the \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute has a value of {\ttfamily 0}. An additional related restriction is that the \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute must default to or be set to {\ttfamily true} if the value of the \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute is {\ttfamily 0}, because a zero-\/dimensional compartment cannot ever have a size.

If a compartment has no size or dimensional units, how should such a compartment\textquotesingle{}s identifier be interpreted when it appears in mathematical formulas? The answer is that such a compartment\textquotesingle{}s identifier should not appear in mathematical formulas in the first place---it has no value, and its value cannot change. Note also that a zero-\/dimensional compartment is a point, and species located at points can only be described in terms of amounts, not spatially-\/dependent measures such as concentration. Since S\+B\+ML \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} formulas are already in terms of {\itshape substance/{\itshape time} and} not (say) {\itshape concentration/{\itshape time},} volume or other factors in principle are not needed for species located in zero-\/dimensional compartments.

Finally, in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Versions 2--4, each compartment in a model may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular compartment {\itshape type}. The optional attribute \char`\"{}compartment\+Type\char`\"{} is used identify the compartment type represented by the \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} structure. The \char`\"{}compartment\+Type\char`\"{} attribute\textquotesingle{}s value must be the identifier of a \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} instance defined in the model. If the \char`\"{}compartment\+Type\char`\"{} attribute is not present on a particular compartment definition, a unique virtual compartment type is assumed for that compartment, and no other compartment can belong to that compartment type. The values of \char`\"{}compartment\+Type\char`\"{} attributes on compartments have no effect on the numerical interpretation of a model. Simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore \char`\"{}compartment\+Type\char`\"{} attributes. The \char`\"{}compartment\+Type\char`\"{} attribute and the \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} class of objects are not present in S\+B\+ML Level~3 Core nor in S\+B\+ML Level~1.\hypertarget{class_compartment_comp-l3}{}\subsection{Additional considerations in S\+B\+M\+L Level 3}\label{class_compartment_comp-l3}
One difference between S\+B\+ML Level~3 and lower Levels of S\+B\+ML is that there are no restrictions on the permissible values of the \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute, and there is no default value defined for the attribute. The value of \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} does not have to be an integer, either; this is to allow for the possibility of representing structures with fractal dimensions.

The number of spatial dimensions possessed by a compartment cannot enter into mathematical formulas, and therefore cannot directly alter the numerical interpretation of a model. However, the value of \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} {\itshape does} affect the interpretation of the units associated with a compartment\textquotesingle{}s size. Specifically, the value of \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} is used to select among the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} attributes \char`\"{}volume\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}area\+Units\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}length\+Units\char`\"{} when a \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} structure does not define a value for its \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute.

The \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute may be left unspecified for a given compartment in a model; in that case, the compartment inherits the unit of measurement specified by one of the attributes on the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object instance. The applicable attribute on \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} depends on the value of the compartment\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute; the relationship is shown in the table below. If the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object does not define the relevant attribute (\char`\"{}volume\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}area\+Units\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}length\+Units\char`\"{}) for a given \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} value, the unit associated with that \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object\textquotesingle{}s size is undefined. If a given \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} are left unset and the \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} either has a value other than {\ttfamily 1}, {\ttfamily 2}, or {\ttfamily 3} or is left unset itself (as it has no default value), then no unit can be chosen from among the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}volume\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}area\+Units\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}length\+Units\char`\"{} attributes (even if the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} instance provides values for those attributes), because there is no basis to select between them. Leaving the units of compartments\textquotesingle{} sizes undefined in an S\+B\+ML model does not render the model invalid; however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that all models specify the units of measurement for all compartment sizes.

The unit of measurement associated with a compartment\textquotesingle{}s size, as defined by the \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute or (if \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} is not set) the inherited value from \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} according to the table above, is used in the following ways\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When the identifier of the compartment appears as a numerical quantity in a mathematical formula expressed in Math\+ML, it represents the size of the compartment, and the unit associated with the size is the value of the \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute.


\item When a \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} is to be treated in terms of concentrations or density, the unit associated with the spatial size portion of the concentration value (i.\+e., the denominator in the formula {\itshape amount}/{\itshape size}) is specified by the value of the \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute on the compartment in which the species is located.


\item The \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} elements of \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} and \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} objects setting the value of the compartment size should all have the same units as the unit associated with the compartment\textquotesingle{}s size.


\item In a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} object that defines a rate of change for a compartment\textquotesingle{}s size, the unit of the rule\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} element should be identical to the compartment\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute divided by the model-\/wide unit of {\itshape time}. (In other words, \{{\itshape unit of compartment size}\}/\{{\itshape unit of time}\}.)


\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{class_compartment_comp-other}{}\subsection{Other aspects of Compartment}\label{class_compartment_comp-other}
In S\+B\+ML Level~1 and Level~2, \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} has an optional attribute named \char`\"{}outside\char`\"{}, whose value can be the identifier of another \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object defined in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object. Doing so means that the other compartment contains it or is outside of it. This enables the representation of simple topological relationships between compartments, for those simulation systems that can make use of the information (e.\+g., for drawing simple diagrams of compartments). It is worth noting that in S\+B\+ML, there is no relationship between compartment sizes when compartment positioning is expressed using the \char`\"{}outside\char`\"{} attribute. The size of a given compartment does not in any sense include the sizes of other compartments having it as the value of their \char`\"{}outside\char`\"{} attributes. In other words, if a compartment {\itshape B} has the identifier of compartment {\itshape A} as its \char`\"{}outside\char`\"{} attribute value, the size of {\itshape A} does not include the size of {\itshape B}. The compartment sizes are separate.

In Level~2, there are two restrictions on the \char`\"{}outside\char`\"{} attribute. First, because a compartment with \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} of {\ttfamily 0} has no size, such a compartment cannot act as the container of any other compartment {\itshape except} compartments that {\itshape also} have \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} values of {\ttfamily 0}. Second, the directed graph formed by representing \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} structures as vertexes and the \char`\"{}outside\char`\"{} attribute values as edges must be acyclic. The latter condition is imposed to prevent a compartment from being contained inside itself. In the absence of a value for \char`\"{}outside\char`\"{}, compartment definitions in S\+B\+ML Level~2 do not have any implied spatial relationships between each other. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a596f9a7a3485a61e0c82ccca59354e83}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a596f9a7a3485a61e0c82ccca59354e83}}

\{core\} A {\itshape compartment type} in S\+B\+ML Level~2.

S\+B\+ML Level~2 Versions~2--4 provide the {\itshape compartment type} as a grouping construct that can be used to establish a relationship between multiple \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} objects. A \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} object only has an identity, and this identity can only be used to indicate that particular \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} objects in the model belong to this type. This may be useful for conveying a modeling intention, such as when a model contains many similar compartments, either by their biological function or the reactions they carry. Without a compartment type construct, it would be impossible within S\+B\+ML itself to indicate that all of the compartments share an underlying conceptual relationship because each S\+B\+ML compartment must be given a unique and separate identity. A \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} has no mathematical meaning in S\+B\+ML---it has no effect on a model\textquotesingle{}s mathematical interpretation. Simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} definitions and references to them in a model.

There is no mechanism in S\+B\+ML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of compartment types. One \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} instance cannot be the subtype of another \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} instance; S\+B\+ML provides no means of defining such relationships.

As with other major structures in S\+B\+ML, \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} has a mandatory attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, used to give the compartment type an identifier. The identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax permitted in S\+B\+ML. \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} also has an optional \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute, of type {\ttfamily string}. The \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specification (e.\+g., Section 3.\+3 in the Level 2 Version 4 specification).

\hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level 2 Version 2. It is not available in S\+B\+ML Level~1 nor in Level~3.

\{core\} An S\+B\+ML {\itshape constraint}, for stating validity assumptions.

The \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} object class was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~2 as a mechanism for stating the assumptions under which a model is designed to operate. The {\itshape constraints} are statements about permissible values of different quantities in a model. Constraints are not used to compute dynamical values for simulation or analysis, but rather, they serve an advisory role for simulation/analysis tools.

S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} object class has one required attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, to give the parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an S\+B\+ML model definition can refer to it. A \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} object can also have an optional \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute of type {\ttfamily string}. Identifiers and names must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specification (e.\+g., Section 3.\+3 in the Level~2 Version 4 specification).

\hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} has one subelement, \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}, containing a Math\+ML formula defining the condition of the constraint. This formula will return a Boolean value of {\ttfamily true} when the model is a {\itshape valid} state. The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the variables and other entities in an S\+B\+ML model. The evaluation of \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} and behavior of constraints are described in more detail below.

In S\+B\+ML Level~2 and S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1, the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement is required, and its formula must be a Boolean value. In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, these restrictions were relaxed\+: the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement is optional, and numeric values are allowed in Boolean contexts (a \textquotesingle{}0\textquotesingle{} is interpreted as {\ttfamily false}, and all other values are interpreted as {\ttfamily true}). If a \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} with no \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} is present in a \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}, no restriction on the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}\textquotesingle{}s behavior is implied or enforced.

A \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} structure also has an optional subelement called \char`\"{}message\char`\"{}. This can contain a message in X\+H\+T\+ML format that may be displayed to the user when the condition of the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement evaluates to a value of {\ttfamily false}. Software tools are not required to display the message, but it is recommended that they do so as a matter of best practice. The X\+H\+T\+ML content within a \char`\"{}message\char`\"{} subelement must follow the same restrictions as for the \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} element on \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} described in in the S\+B\+ML Level~2 specification; please consult the \href{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications}{\tt S\+B\+ML specification document} corresponding to the S\+B\+ML Level and Version of your model for more information about the requirements for \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} content.

\hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~2. It is not available in earlier versions of Level~2 nor in any version of Level~1.\hypertarget{class_constraint_constraint-semantics}{}\subsection{Semantics of Constraints}\label{class_constraint_constraint-semantics}
In the context of a simulation, a \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} has effect at all times {\itshape t $\geq$ 0}. Each \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement is first evaluated after any \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} definitions in a model at {\itshape t = 0} and can conceivably trigger at that point. (In other words, a simulation could fail a constraint immediately.)

\hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} structures {\itshape cannot and should not} be used to compute the dynamical behavior of a model as part of, for example, simulation. Constraints may be used as input to non-\/dynamical analysis, for instance by expressing flux constraints for flux balance analysis.

The results of a simulation of a model containing a constraint are invalid from any simulation time at and after a point when the function given by the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement returns a value of {\ttfamily false}. Invalid simulation results do not make a prediction of the behavior of the biochemical reaction network represented by the model. The precise behavior of simulation tools is left undefined with respect to constraints. If invalid results are detected with respect to a given constraint, the \char`\"{}message\char`\"{} subelement may optionally be displayed to the user. The simulation tool may also halt the simulation or clearly delimit in output data the simulation time point at which the simulation results become invalid.

S\+B\+ML does not impose restrictions on duplicate \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} definitions or the order of evaluation of \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint} objects in a model. It is possible for a model to define multiple constraints all with the same mathematical expression. Since the failure of any constraint indicates that the model simulation has entered an invalid state, a system is not required to attempt to detect whether other constraints in the model have failed once any one constraint has failed. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a98415d0ae45c54b908571819751fa54a}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a98415d0ae45c54b908571819751fa54a}}

\{core\} A M\+I\+R\+I\+A\+M-\/compliant controlled vocabulary term.



The S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3 specifications define a simple format for annotating models when (a) referring to controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers that define and describe biological and biochemical entities, and (b) describing the creator of a model and the model\textquotesingle{}s modification history. This S\+B\+ML format is a concrete syntax that conforms to the guidelines of M\+I\+R\+I\+AM (\href{http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v23/n12/abs/nbt1156.html}{\tt \char`\"{}\+Minimum
  Information Requested in the Annotation of biochemical Models\char`\"{}}, {\itshape Nature Biotechnology}, vol. 23, no. 12, Dec. 2005). The format uses a subset of W3C R\+DF (\href{http://www.w3.org/RDF/}{\tt Resource Description Format}). In order to help application developers work with annotations in this format, lib\+S\+B\+ML provides several helper classes that provide higher-\/level interfaces to the data elements; these classes include \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term}, \hyperlink{class_model_creator}{Model\+Creator}, \hyperlink{class_model_history}{Model\+History}, \hyperlink{class_r_d_f_annotation_parser}{R\+D\+F\+Annotation\+Parser}, and \hyperlink{class_date}{Date}.\hypertarget{class_c_v_term_annotation-parts}{}\subsection{Components of an S\+B\+M\+L annotation}\label{class_c_v_term_annotation-parts}
The S\+B\+ML annotation format consists of R\+D\+F-\/based content placed inside an {\ttfamily $<$annotation$>$} element attached to an S\+B\+ML component such as \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, etc. A small change was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~5 and S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2 to permit nested annotations\+: lower Versions of the S\+B\+ML specifications did not explicitly allow this. We first describe the different parts of S\+B\+ML annotations in X\+ML form for S\+B\+ML Level~2 below Version~5 and S\+B\+ML Level~3 below Version~2\+:

In the template above, the placeholder S\+B\+M\+L\+\_\+\+E\+L\+E\+M\+E\+NT stands for the X\+ML tag name of an S\+B\+ML model component (e.\+g., {\ttfamily model}, {\ttfamily reaction}, etc.) and the placeholder meta id stands for the element\textquotesingle{}s meta identifier, which is a field available on all S\+B\+ML components derived from the \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} base object class. The dotted portions are optional, the symbol +++ is a placeholder for either no content or valid X\+ML content that is not defined by this annotation scheme, and the ellipses ... are placeholders for zero or more elements of the same form as the immediately preceding element. The optional content H\+I\+S\+T\+O\+RY is a creation and modification history; in lib\+S\+B\+ML, this is stored using \hyperlink{class_model_history}{Model\+History} objects.

The placeholder R\+E\+L\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+E\+L\+E\+M\+E\+NT refers to a Bio\+Models.\+net qualifier element name. This is an element in either the X\+ML namespace {\ttfamily \char`\"{}http\+://biomodels.\+net/model-\/qualifiers\char`\"{}} (for model qualifiers) or {\ttfamily \char`\"{}http\+://biomodels.\+net/biology-\/qualifiers\char`\"{}} (for biological qualifier). Note that these namespace U\+R\+Is are only labels, and not actual Web locations, which means you cannot visit an address such as {\ttfamily \char`\"{}http\+://biomodels.\+net/model-\/qualifiers\char`\"{}} in your browser or try to have your application access it.

The U\+RI is a required data value that uniquely identifies a resource and data within that resource to which the annotation refers. Again, being U\+R\+Is, these do not refer to physical Web locations; nevertheless, applications will often want a means of finding the resource to which a given U\+RI refers. Providing the facilities for this task is the purpose of M\+I\+R\+I\+AM Resources, described in detail online at \href{http://biomodels.net/miriam}{\tt http\+://biomodels.\+net/miriam}) and also in the paper \href{http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/1/58}{\tt \char`\"{}\+M\+I\+R\+I\+A\+M Resources\+: tools to generate and
  resolve robust cross-\/references in Systems Biology\char`\"{}}, {\itshape B\+MC Systems Biology}, 58(1), 2007.

The placeholder N\+E\+S\+T\+E\+D\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+T\+E\+NT refers to other optional R\+DF elements such as {\ttfamily \char`\"{}bqbiol\+:is\+Described\+By\char`\"{}} that describe a clarification or another annotation about the R\+E\+L\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+E\+L\+E\+M\+E\+NT in which it appears. Nested content allows one to, for example, describe protein modifications on species, or to add evidence codes for an annotation. Nested content relates to its containing R\+E\+L\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+E\+L\+E\+M\+E\+NT, not the other way around. It qualifies it, but does not change its meaning. As such, ignoring a N\+E\+S\+T\+E\+D\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+T\+E\+NT does not affect the information provided by the containing R\+E\+L\+A\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+E\+L\+E\+M\+E\+NT.

For more information about S\+B\+ML annotations in general, please refer to Section~6 in the S\+B\+ML Level~2 (Versions 2--4) or Level~3 specification documents.\hypertarget{class_c_v_term_cvterm-parts}{}\subsection{The parts of a C\+V\+Term}\label{class_c_v_term_cvterm-parts}
Annotations that refer to controlled vocabularies are managed in lib\+S\+B\+ML using \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} objects. The relation-\/resource pairs discussed in the previous section are the \char`\"{}controlled vocabulary\char`\"{} terms that \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} is designed to store and manipulate. A set of R\+D\+F-\/based annotations attached to a given S\+B\+ML {\ttfamily $<$annotation$>$} element are read by \hyperlink{class_r_d_f_annotation_parser}{R\+D\+F\+Annotation\+Parser} and converted into a list of these \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} objects. Each \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} object instance stores the following components of an annotation\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\itshape qualifier}, which can be a Bio\+Models.\+net \char`\"{}biological
  qualifier\char`\"{}, a Bio\+Models.\+net \char`\"{}model qualifier\char`\"{}, or an unknown qualifier (as far as the \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} class is concerned). Qualifiers are used in M\+I\+R\+I\+AM to indicate the nature of the relationship between the object being annotated and the resource. In \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term}, the qualifiers can be manipulated using the methods C\+V\+Term\+::get\+Qualifier\+Type(), C\+V\+Term\+::set\+Qualifier\+Type(), and related methods.


\item The {\itshape resource}, represented by a U\+RI (which, we must remind developers, is not the same as a U\+RL). In the \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} class, the resource component can be manipulated using the methods C\+V\+Term\+::add\+Resource() and C\+V\+Term\+::remove\+Resource().


\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that a \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} contains a single qualifier, but possibly more than one resource. This corresponds to the possibility of an annotation that points to multiple resources, all of which are qualified by the same Bio\+Models.\+net qualifier. The \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} object class supports this by supporting a list of resources.

Detailed explanations of the qualifiers defined by Bio\+Models.\+net can be found at \href{http://co.mbine.org/standards/qualifiers}{\tt http\+://co.\+mbine.\+org/standards/qualifiers}. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a8bb9697ebb40c1d9b33cc96043295249}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a8bb9697ebb40c1d9b33cc96043295249}}

\{core\} A M\+I\+R\+I\+A\+M-\/compliant date representation.



A \hyperlink{class_date}{Date} object stores a reasonably complete representation of date and time. Its purpose is to serve as a way to store dates to be read and written in the \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime}{\tt W3C date format} used in R\+DF Dublin Core annotations within S\+B\+ML. The W3C date format is a restricted form of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601}{\tt I\+SO 8601}, the international standard for the representation of dates and times. A time and date value in this W3C format takes the form Y\+Y\+Y\+Y-\/\+M\+M-\/\+D\+D\+Thh\+:mm\+:ss\+X\+HH\+:ZZ (e.\+g., {\ttfamily 1997-\/07-\/16\+T19\+:20\+:30+01\+:00}) where X\+HH\+:ZZ is the time zone offset. The lib\+S\+B\+ML \hyperlink{class_date}{Date} object contains the following fields to represent these values\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape year\+:} an unsigned int representing the year. This should be a four-\/digit number such as {\ttfamily 2011}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape month\+:} an unsigned int representing the month, with a range of values of 1--12. The value {\ttfamily 1} represents January, and so on.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape day\+:} an unsigned int representing the day of the month, with a range of values of 1--31.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape hour\+:} an unsigned int representing the hour on a 24-\/hour clock, with a range of values of 0--23.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape minute\+:} an unsigned int representing the minute, with a range of 0--59.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape second\+:} an unsigned int representing the second, with a range of 0--59.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape sign\+:} an unsigned int representing the sign of the offset ({\ttfamily 0} signifying {\ttfamily +} and {\ttfamily 1} signifying {\ttfamily -\/}). See the paragraph below for further explanations.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape hours} {\itshape offset\+:} an unsigned int representing the time zone\textquotesingle{}s hour offset from G\+MT, with a range of 0--12.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape minute} {\itshape offset\+:} an unsigned int representing the time zone\textquotesingle{}s minute offset from G\+MT, with a range of 0--59.\end{DoxyItemize}
To illustrate the time zone offset, a value of {\ttfamily -\/05\+:00} would correspond to U\+SA Eastern Standard Time. In the \hyperlink{class_date}{Date} object, this would require a value of {\ttfamily 1} for the sign field, {\ttfamily 5} for the hour offset and {\ttfamily 0} for the minutes offset.

In the restricted R\+DF annotations used in S\+B\+ML, described in Section~6 of the S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3 specification documents, date/time stamps can be used to indicate the time of creation and modification of a model. The following S\+B\+ML model fragment illustrates this\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<model metaid="_180340" id="GMO" name="Goldbeter1991_MinMitOscil">

\{core\} A delay on the time of execution of an S\+B\+ML {\itshape event}.

An \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected. The effect of the event can optionally be delayed after the occurrence of the condition which invokes it. An event delay is defined using an object of class \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay}.

The object class \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} is derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} and adds a single subelement called \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. This subelement is used to hold Math\+ML content. The mathematical formula represented by \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} must evaluate to a numerical value. It is used as the length of time between when the event is {\itshape triggered} and when the event\textquotesingle{}s assignments are actually {\itshape executed}. If no delay is present on a given \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}, a time delay of zero is assumed.

The expression in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} must be evaluated at the time the event is {\itshape triggered}. The expression must always evaluate to a nonnegative number (otherwise, a nonsensical situation could arise where an event is defined to execute before it is triggered!).\hypertarget{class_delay_delay-units}{}\subsection{The units of the mathematical expression in a Delay}\label{class_delay_delay-units}
In S\+B\+ML Level~2 versions before Version~4, the units of the numerical value computed by the \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expression are {\itshape required} to be in units of time, or the model is considered to have a unit consistency error. In Level~2 Version~4 as well as S\+B\+ML Level~3, this requirement is relaxed; these specifications only stipulate that the units of the numerical value computed by a \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} instance\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expression {\itshape should} match the model\textquotesingle{}s units of time (meaning the definition of the {\ttfamily time} units in the model). Lib\+S\+B\+ML respects these requirements, and depending on whether an earlier Version of S\+B\+ML Level~2 is in use, lib\+S\+B\+ML may or may not flag unit inconsistencies as errors or merely warnings.

Note that {\itshape units are not predefined or assumed} for the contents of \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} in a \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} object; rather, they must be defined explicitly for each instance of a \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} object in a model. This is an important point to bear in mind when literal numbers are used in delay expressions. For example, the following \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} instance would result in a warning logged by S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency() about the fact that lib\+S\+B\+ML cannot verify the consistency of the units of the expression. The reason is that the formula inside the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} element does not have any declared units, whereas what is expected in this context is units of time\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<model>
    ...
    <listOfEvents>
        <event useValuesFromTriggerTime="true">
            ...
            <delay>
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                    <cn> 1 </cn>
                </math>
            </delay>
            ...
        </event>
    </listOfEvents>
    ...
</model>
\end{DoxyVerb}


The {\ttfamily $<$cn$>$ 1 $<$/cn$>$} within the mathematical formula of the {\ttfamily delay} above has {\itshape no units declared}. To make the expression have the needed units of time, literal numbers should be avoided in favor of defining \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} objects for each quantity, and declaring units for the \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} values. The following fragment of S\+B\+ML illustrates this approach\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<model>
    ...
    <listOfParameters>
        <parameter id="transcriptionDelay" value="10" units="second"/>
    </listOfParameters>
    ...
    <listOfEvents>
        <event useValuesFromTriggerTime="true">
            ...
            <delay>
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
                    <ci> transcriptionDelay </ci>
                </math>
            </delay>
            ...
        </event>
    </listOfEvents>
    ...
</model>
\end{DoxyVerb}


In S\+B\+ML Level~3, an alternative approach is available in the form of the {\ttfamily units} attribute, which S\+B\+ML Level~3 allows to appear on Math\+ML {\ttfamily cn} elements. The value of this attribute can be used to indicate the unit of measurement to be associated with the number in the content of a {\ttfamily cn} element. The attribute is named {\ttfamily units} but, because it appears inside Math\+ML element (which is in the X\+ML namespace for Math\+ML and not the namespace for S\+B\+ML), it must always be prefixed with an X\+ML namespace prefix for an S\+B\+ML Level~3 namespace. The following is an example of this approach\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<model timeUnits="second" ...>
    ...
    <listOfEvents>
        <event useValuesFromTriggerTime="true">
            ...
            <delay>
                <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"
                      xmlns:sbml="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level3/version1/core">
                    <cn sbml:units="second"> 10 </cn>
                </math>
            </delay>
            ...
        </event>

In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the requirement that a \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} have a \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement was relaxed, making it optional. In this case, the \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} remains undefined, and unless that information is provided in some other form (such as with an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package), the \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} behaves as if it had no \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay}. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_ae2b13a010fa6a60e9e81f4118056d57e}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_ae2b13a010fa6a60e9e81f4118056d57e}}

\{core\} A discontinuous S\+B\+ML {\itshape event}.

An S\+B\+ML \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are affected by it, how the variables are affected, and the event\textquotesingle{}s relationship to other events. The effect of the event can optionally be delayed after the occurrence of the condition which invokes it.

The operation of \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} is divided into two phases (even when the event is not delayed)\+: one when the event is {\itshape triggered}, and the other when the event is {\itshape executed}. \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} objects define the conditions for triggering an event, \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} objects define when the event is actually executed, \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} objects define the effects of executing the event, and (in S\+B\+ML Level~3) \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} objects influence the order of \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} performance in cases of simultaneous events. Please consult the descriptions of \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger}, \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay}, \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} and \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} for more information.\hypertarget{class_event_event-version-diffs}{}\subsection{S\+B\+M\+L Level/\+Version differences}\label{class_event_event-version-diffs}
\hypertarget{class_event_sbml-l2}{}\subsubsection{S\+B\+M\+L Level 2}\label{class_event_sbml-l2}
In S\+B\+ML Level~2 versions before Version~4, the semantics of \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} time delays were defined such that the expressions in the event\textquotesingle{}s assignments were always evaluated at the time the event was {\itshape triggered}. This definition made it difficult to define an event whose assignment formulas were meant to be evaluated at the time the event was {\itshape executed} (i.\+e., after the time period defined by the value of the \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} element, or after any other simultaneous event may have been {\itshape executed} and changed the model state). In S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in Level~3, the attribute \char`\"{}use\+Values\+From\+Trigger\+Time\char`\"{} on \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} was added to allow a model to indicate the time at which the event\textquotesingle{}s assignments are to be calculated, whether at the moment the event is triggered (if the value of the attribute is {\ttfamily true}), or at the moment of execution (if \char`\"{}use\+Values\+From\+Trigger\+Time\char`\"{}={\ttfamily false}). If the event has a delay, the \char`\"{}use\+Values\+From\+Trigger\+Time\char`\"{} is likely to make a significant difference in the values used in the assignment, but the possibility of simultaneous events mean that even zero-\/delay events can have different results depending on the value of this attribute.

The definition of \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Versions 1 and 2 includes an additional attribute called \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{}, which allowed the time units of the \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} to be set explicitly. Later Versions of S\+B\+ML Level~2 as well as S\+B\+ML Level~3 do not define this attribute. Lib\+S\+B\+ML supports this attribute for compatibility with previous versions of S\+B\+ML Level~2; however, if a model in S\+B\+ML Level~3 or Level~2 Versions~3--4 format sets the attribute, the consistency-\/checking method S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency() will report an error.

The attribute \char`\"{}use\+Values\+From\+Trigger\+Time\char`\"{} was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4. Models defined in prior Versions of S\+B\+ML Level~2 cannot use this attribute, and S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency() will report an error if they do.\hypertarget{class_event_sbml-l3}{}\subsubsection{S\+B\+M\+L Level 3}\label{class_event_sbml-l3}
S\+B\+ML Level 3 introduces several changes to the structure and components of Events compared to S\+B\+ML Level~2. These changes fall into two main categories\+: changes to what is optional or required, and additions of new attributes and elements. 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The attribute \char`\"{}use\+Values\+From\+Trigger\+Time\char`\"{} on \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} is mandatory (it was optional in Level~2 and had a default value of {\ttfamily true}); 
\item \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Event\+Assignments\char`\"{} element (of class \hyperlink{class_list_of_event_assignments}{List\+Of\+Event\+Assignments}) is optional (it was mandatory in Level~2); 
\item \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}priority\char`\"{} element (of class \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority}) is new in Level~3; and 
\item The \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} object gains new mandatory attributes (described as part of the definition of \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger}). 
\item In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} object became optional. An \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} with no \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} will simply not fire. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The changes to the attributes of \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} are described below; the changes to \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} and \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} are described in their respective sections.\hypertarget{class_event_semantics}{}\subsection{Semantics of events in S\+B\+M\+L Level 3 Version 1}\label{class_event_semantics}
The detailed semantics of events are described in the specification documents for each S\+B\+ML Level/\+Version. Here we include the description from the S\+B\+ML Level~1 Version~1. Any transition of a \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula from the value {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true} will cause the enclosing \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object to {\itshape trigger}. Such a transition is not possible at the very start of a simulation (i.\+e., at time {\itshape t = 0}) unless the \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}initial\+Value\char`\"{} attribute has a value of {\ttfamily false}; this defines the value of the trigger formula to be {\ttfamily false} immediately prior to the start of simulation, thereby giving it the potential to change in value from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true} when the formula is evaluated at {\itshape t = 0}. If \char`\"{}initial\+Value\char`\"{}={\ttfamily true}, then the trigger expression cannot transition from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true} at {\itshape t = 0} but may do so at some time {\itshape t $>$ 0}.

Consider an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object definition {\itshape E} with delay {\itshape d} in which the \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula makes a transition in value from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true} at times {\itshape t\textsubscript{1}} and {\itshape t\textsubscript{2}}. The \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} within the \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object will have effect at {\itshape t\textsubscript{1} + d} and {\itshape t\textsubscript{2} + d} irrespective of the relative times of {\itshape t\textsubscript{1}} and {\itshape t\textsubscript{2}}. For example, events can \char`\"{}overlap\char`\"{} so that {\itshape t\textsubscript{1} $<$ t\textsubscript{2} $<$ t\textsubscript{1} + d} still causes an event assignments to occur at {\itshape t\textsubscript{1} + d} and {\itshape t\textsubscript{2} + d}.

It is entirely possible for two events to be executed simultaneously, and it is possible for events to trigger other events (i.\+e., an event assignment can cause an event to trigger). This leads to several points\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A software package should retest all event triggers after executing an event assignment in order to account for the possibility that the assignment causes another event trigger to transition from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true}. This check should be made after each individual \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object\textquotesingle{}s execution, even when several events are to be executed simultaneously.


\item Any \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object whose \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} \char`\"{}persistent\char`\"{} attribute has the value {\ttfamily false} must have its trigger expression reevaluated continuously between when the event is triggered and when it is executed. If its trigger expression ever evaluates to {\ttfamily false}, it must be removed from the queue of events pending execution and treated as any other event whose trigger expression evaluates to {\ttfamily false}.


\item Although the precise time at which events are executed is not resolved beyond the given execution point in simulated time, it is assumed that the order in which the events occur {\itshape is} resolved. This order can be significant in determining the overall outcome of a given simulation. When an event {\itshape X} {\itshape triggers} another event {\itshape Y} and event {\itshape Y} has zero delay, then event {\itshape Y} is added to the existing set of simultaneous events that are pending {\itshape execution}. Events {\itshape X} and {\itshape Y} form a cascade of events at the same point in simulation time. An event such as {\itshape Y} may have a special priority if it contains a \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} subobject.


\item All events in a model are open to being in a cascade. The position of an event in the event queue does not affect whether it can be in the cascade\+: event {\itshape Y} can be triggered whether it is before or after {\itshape X} in the queue of events pending execution. A cascade of events can be potentially infinite (never terminate); when this occurs a simulator should indicate this has occurred---it is incorrect for a simulator to break a cascade arbitrarily and continue the simulation without at least indicating that the infinite cascade occurred.


\item Simultaneous events having no defined priorities are executed in an undefined order. This does not mean that the behavior of the simulation is completely undefined; merely that the {\itshape order} of execution of these particular events is undefined. A given simulator may use any algorithm to choose an order as long as every event is executed exactly once.


\item Events with defined priorities are executed in the order implied by their \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula values, with events having higher priorities being executed ahead of events with lower priorities, and events with identical priorities being executed in a random order with respect to one another (as determined at run-\/time by some random algorithm equivalent to coin-\/flipping). Newly-\/triggered events that are to be executed immediately (i.\+e., if they define no delays) should be inserted into the queue of events pending execution according to their priorities\+: events with higher priority values value must be inserted ahead of events with lower priority values and after any pending events with even higher priorities, and inserted randomly among pending events with the same priority values. Events without \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} objects must be inserted into the queue in some fashion, but the algorithm used to place it in the queue is undefined. Similarly, there is no restriction on the order of a newly-\/inserted event with a defined \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} with respect to any other pending \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} without a defined \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority}.


\item A model variable that is the target of one or more event assignments can change more than once when simultaneous events are processed at some time point {\itshape t}. The model\textquotesingle{}s behavior (output) for such a variable is the value of the variable at the end of processing all the simultaneous events at time {\itshape t}.


\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{class_event_l3v2_restrictions}{}\subsection{Restrictions relaxed in S\+B\+M\+L Level 3 Version 2}\label{class_event_l3v2_restrictions}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, several restrictions were lifted that have the potential to affect the semantics of an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} subobject of an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} is optional. If missing, an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} is never {\itshape triggered}, unless an alternate triggering scheme is introduced by an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package.


\item The \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelements of an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger}, \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay}, \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority}, and \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} are all optional. If any of these elements lack a \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement, and that information is not supplied in an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package, it is mathematically equivalent to the \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger}, \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay}, \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority}, or \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} not being present at all.


\item The \hyperlink{class_list_of_event_assignments}{List\+Of\+Event\+Assignments} may be empty, which is mathematically equivalent to the \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} not having a \hyperlink{class_list_of_event_assignments}{List\+Of\+Event\+Assignments} at all.


\item Any \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement may return a Boolean or a numeric value in any context. If a numeric value is used in a Boolean context, a \char`\"{}0\char`\"{} is interpreted as {\ttfamily false}, and all other values are interpreted as {\ttfamily true}. If a Boolean value is used in a numeric context, a {\ttfamily true} is interpreted as a 1, and a {\ttfamily false} is interpreted as a 0. This means (for example) that a \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} value that changes from 0.\+0 to anything else is equivalent to changing from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true}.

\{core\} An assignment to a variable by an S\+B\+ML {\itshape event}.

\hyperlink{class_event}{Event} contains an optional element called \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Event\+Assignments\char`\"{}, of class \hyperlink{class_list_of_event_assignments}{List\+Of\+Event\+Assignments}. In every instance of an event definition in a model, the object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Event\+Assignments\char`\"{} element must have a non-\/empty list of one or more \char`\"{}event\+Assignment\char`\"{} elements of class \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}. The object class \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} has one required attribute, \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}, and a required element, \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. Being derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}, it also has all the usual attributes and elements of its parent class.

An \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected. The purpose of the \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} object class is to define how variables are affected by an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, every \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object instance must have a nonempty list of event assignments; in S\+B\+ML Level~3, the list of assignments is optional.

The operation of an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} is divided into two phases (regardless of whether a delay is involved)\+: one phase when the event is {\itshape triggered}, and the other when the event is {\itshape executed}. \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} objects are interpreted when an event is executed. The effects are described below.\hypertarget{class_event_assignment_event-variable}{}\subsection{The attribute \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}}\label{class_event_assignment_event-variable}
The \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} attribute \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} must be the identifier of an existing \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference}, or \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} instance defined in the model. In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, this list was expanded to include identifiers of S\+B\+ML Level~3 package variables that have both mathematical meaning and the ability to be assigned. When the event is executed, the value of the model component identified by \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} is changed by the \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} to the value computed by the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} element; that is, a species\textquotesingle{} quantity, species reference\textquotesingle{}s stoichiometry, compartment\textquotesingle{}s size or parameter\textquotesingle{}s value are reset to the value computed by \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}.

Certain restrictions are placed on what can appear in \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The object identified by the value of the \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} attribute \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} must not have its \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute set to or default to {\ttfamily true}. (Constants cannot be affected by events.)


\item The \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute must not contain the identifier of a reaction. In S\+B\+ML Level~2 and S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1, only species, species references, compartment and parameter values may be set by an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}. In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute may also be the identifier of an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package element with mathematical meaning and the ability to be assigned a value. This situation may only arise if the S\+B\+ML package is present in the S\+B\+ML document with a package\+:required attribute of {\ttfamily true} 


\item The value of every \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute must be unique among the set of \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} structures within a given \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} structure. In other words, a single event cannot have multiple \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} objects assigning the same variable. (All of them would be performed at the same time when that particular \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} triggers, resulting in indeterminacy.) However, {\itshape separate} \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} instances can refer to the same variable.


\item A variable cannot be assigned a value in an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} object instance and also be assigned a value by an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}; i.\+e., the value of an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute cannot be the same as the value of a \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}\textquotesingle{} \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute. (Assignment rules hold at all times, therefore it would be inconsistent to also define an event that reassigns the value of the same variable.) 
\end{DoxyItemize}

If the variable attribute of an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} object references an object in an S\+B\+ML namespace that is not understood by the interpreter reading a given S\+B\+ML document (that is, if the object is defined by an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package that the software does not support), the event assignment must be ignored--the object\textquotesingle{}s value will not need to be set, as the interpreter could not understand that package. If an interpreter cannot establish whether a referenced object is missing from the model or instead is defined in an S\+B\+ML namespace not understood by the interpreter, it may produce a warning to the user. (The latter situation may only arise if an S\+B\+ML package is present in the S\+B\+ML document with a package\+:required attribute of \char`\"{}true\char`\"{}.)

Note that the time of assignment of the object identified by the value of the \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute is always the time at which the \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} is {\itshape executed}, not when it is {\itshape triggered}. The timing is controlled by the optional \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} in an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}. The time of assignment is not affected by the \char`\"{}use\+Values\+From\+Trigger\+Time\char`\"{} attribute on \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}---that attribute affects the time at which the \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expression is {\itshape evaluated}. In other words, S\+B\+ML allows decoupling the time at which the \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} is assigned from the time at which its value expression is calculated.\hypertarget{class_event_assignment_event-math}{}\subsection{The \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement in an Event\+Assignment}\label{class_event_assignment_event-math}
The Math\+ML expression contained in an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} defines the new value of the variable being assigned by the \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}.

As mentioned above, the time at which the expression in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} is evaluated is determined by the attribute \char`\"{}use\+Values\+From\+Trigger\+Time\char`\"{} on \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}. If the attribute value is {\ttfamily true}, the expression must be evaluated when the event is {\itshape triggered}; more precisely, the values of identifiers occurring in Math\+ML {\ttfamily $<$ci$>$} elements in the \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expression are the values they have at the point when the event {\itshape triggered}. If, instead, \char`\"{}use\+Values\+From\+Trigger\+Time\char`\"{}\textquotesingle{}s value is {\ttfamily false}, it means the values at {\itshape execution} time should be used; that is, the values of identifiers occurring in Math\+ML {\ttfamily $<$ci$>$} elements in the \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expression are the values they have at the point when the event {\itshape executed}.\hypertarget{class_event_assignment_eventassignment-version-diffs}{}\subsection{S\+B\+M\+L Level/\+Version differences}\label{class_event_assignment_eventassignment-version-diffs}
Between Version~4 and previous versions of S\+B\+ML Level~2, the requirements regarding the matching of units between an Eveng\+Assignment\textquotesingle{}s formula and the units of the object identified by the \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute changed. Previous versions required consistency, but in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in S\+B\+ML Level~3, unit consistency is only {\itshape recommended}. More precisely\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In the case of a species, an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} sets the referenced species\textquotesingle{} quantity (concentration or amount of substance) to the value determined by the formula in the \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement. The units of the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula should (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in Level~3) or must (in previous Versions of Level~2) be identical to the units of the species.


\item (S\+B\+ML Level~3 only.) In the case of a species reference, an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} sets the stoichiometry of the reactant or product referenced by the \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} object to the value determined by the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} element. The unit associated with the value produced by the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula should be {\ttfamily dimensionless}, because reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless quantities.


\item In the case of a compartment, an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} sets the referenced compartment\textquotesingle{}s size to the size determined by the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement of the \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}. The overall units of the formula should (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in Level~3) or must (in previous Versions of Level~2) be identical to the units specified for the size of the compartment identified by the \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute.


\item In the case of a parameter, an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} sets the referenced parameter\textquotesingle{}s value to that determined by the formula in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. The overall units of the formula should (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and Level~3) or must (in previous Versions of Level~2) be identical to the units defined for the parameter.


\item (For S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2 only) {\itshape In the case of an object from an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package}, an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} sets the referenced object\textquotesingle{}s value (as defined by that package) to the value of the formula in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. The unit of measurement associated with the value produced by the formula should be the same as that object\textquotesingle{}s units attribute value (if it has such an attribute), or be equal to the units of model components of that type (if objects of that class are defined by the package as having the same units). 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Note that the formula placed in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} element {\itshape has no assumed units}. The consistency of the units of the formula, and the units of the entity which the assignment affects, must be explicitly established just as in the case of the value of the \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} subelement. An approach similar to the one discussed in the context of \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} may be used for the formula of an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}.\hypertarget{class_event_assignment_event-asnt-restrictions}{}\subsection{Restrictions relaxed in S\+B\+M\+L Level 3 Version 2}\label{class_event_assignment_event-asnt-restrictions}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the requirement that an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} have a \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement was relaxed, making it optional. In this case, the \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} remains undefined, and unless that information is provided in some other form (such as with an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package), the \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} behaves as if it had no \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}.

\{core\} A user-\/defined function in an S\+B\+ML model.

The \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} structure associates an identifier with a function definition. This identifier can then be used as the function called in subsequent Math\+ML content elsewhere in an S\+B\+ML model.

\hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} has one required attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, to give the function a unique identifier by which other parts of an S\+B\+ML model definition can refer to it. A \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} instance can also have an optional \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute of type {\ttfamily string}. Identifiers and names must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specification (e.\+g., Section 3.\+3 in the Level 2 Version 4 specification).

\hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} has a \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement containing a Math\+ML expression defining the function body. In S\+B\+ML Level~2 and S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1, that \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement is required; in S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, this restriction was relaxed, making the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement optional. The content of this element can only be a Math\+ML \char`\"{}lambda\char`\"{} element. The \char`\"{}lambda\char`\"{} element must begin with zero or more \char`\"{}bvar\char`\"{} elements, followed by any other of the elements in the Math\+ML subset allowed in S\+B\+ML Level 2 {\itshape except} \char`\"{}lambda\char`\"{} (i.\+e., a \char`\"{}lambda\char`\"{} element cannot contain another \char`\"{}lambda\char`\"{} element). This is the only place in S\+B\+ML where a \char`\"{}lambda\char`\"{} element can be used. The function defined by a \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} is only available for use in other Math\+ML elements that {\itshape follow} the \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} definition in the model. (These restrictions prevent recursive and mutually-\/recursive functions from being expressed.)

A further restriction on the content of \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} is that it cannot contain references to variables other than the variables declared to the \char`\"{}lambda\char`\"{} itself. That is, the contents of Math\+ML \char`\"{}ci\char`\"{} elements inside the body of the \char`\"{}lambda\char`\"{} can only be the variables declared by its \char`\"{}bvar\char`\"{} elements, or the identifiers of other \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} instances in the model. This means must be written so that all variables or parameters used in the Math\+ML content are passed to them via their function parameters. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, this restriction applies also to the Math\+ML {\ttfamily csymbol} elements for {\itshape time} and {\itshape delay}; in S\+B\+ML Level~3, it additionally applies to the {\ttfamily csymbol} element for {\itshape avogadro}.

In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, if no math element is present in the \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition}, the function has no mathematical meaning defined in S\+B\+ML Level~3 Core. This situation may arise when models are incomplete, or when additional meanings are provided by an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Function definitions (also informally known as user-\/defined functions) were introduced in S\+B\+ML Level 2. They have purposefully limited capabilities. A function cannot reference parameters or other model quantities outside of itself; values must be passed as parameters to the function. Moreover, recursive and mutually-\/recursive functions are not permitted. The purpose of these limitations is to balance power against complexity of implementation. With the restrictions as they are, function definitions could be implemented as textual substitutions---they are simply macros. Software implementations therefore do not need the full function-\/definition machinery typically associated with programming languages. ~\newline
~\newline
 Another important point to note is \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} does not have a separate attribute for defining the units of the value returned by the function. The units associated with the function\textquotesingle{}s return value, when the function is called from within Math\+ML expressions elsewhere in S\+B\+ML, are simply the overall units of the expression in \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement when applied to the arguments supplied in the call to the function. Ascertaining these units requires performing dimensional analysis on the expression. (Readers may wonder why there is no attribute. The reason is that having a separate attribute for declaring the units would not only be redundant, but also lead to the potential for having conflicting information. In the case of a conflict between the declared units and those of the value actually returned by the function, the only logical resolution rule would be to assume that the correct units are those of the expression anyway.)

\{core\} An S\+B\+ML {\itshape initial assignment}, evaluated once only.

S\+B\+ML Level 2 Versions 2--4 and S\+B\+ML Level~3 provide two ways of assigning initial values to entities in a model. The simplest and most basic is to set the values of the appropriate attributes in the relevant components; for example, the initial value of a model parameter (whether it is a constant or a variable) can be assigned by setting its \char`\"{}value\char`\"{} attribute directly in the model definition. However, this approach is not suitable when the value must be calculated, because the initial value attributes on different components such as species, compartments, and parameters are single values and not mathematical expressions. In those situations, the \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} construct can be used; it permits the calculation of the value of a constant or the initial value of a variable from the values of {\itshape other} quantities in a model.

As explained below, the provision of \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} does not mean that models necessarily must use this construct when defining initial values of quantities in a model. If a value can be set directly using the relevant attribute of a component in a model, then that approach may be more efficient and more portable to other software tools. \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} should be used when the other mechanism is insufficient for the needs of a particular model.

The \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} construct has some similarities to \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}. The main differences are\+: (a) an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} can set the value of a constant whereas an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} cannot, and (b) unlike \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} definition only applies up to and including the beginning of simulation time, i.\+e., {\itshape t $\leq$ 0}, while an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} applies at all times.

\hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} has a required attribute, \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{}, whose value must follow the guidelines for identifiers described in the S\+B\+ML specification (e.\+g., Section 3.\+3 in the Level 2 Version 4 specification). The value of this attribute in an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} object can be the identifier of a \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} (in S\+B\+ML Level~3), global \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}, or (as of S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2) the identifier of a S\+B\+ML Level~3 package element with mathematical meaning. The \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} defines the initial value of the constant or variable referred to by the \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{} attribute. (The attribute\textquotesingle{}s name is \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{} rather than \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} because it may assign values to constants as well as variables in a model.) Note that an initial assignment cannot be made to reaction identifiers, that is, the \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{} attribute value of an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} cannot be an identifier that is the \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attribute value of a \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} object in the model. This is identical to a restriction placed on rules.

\hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} also has a \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement that contains a Math\+ML expression used to calculate the value of the constant or the initial value of the variable. This subelement is required in S\+B\+ML Level~2 and S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1, but the requirement was relaxed in S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, making it optional. The units of the value computed by the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement should (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in S\+B\+ML Level~3) or must (in previous Versions) be identical to be the units associated with the identifier given in the \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{} attribute. (That is, the units are the units of the species, compartment, or parameter, as appropriate for the kind of object identified by the value of \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{}.)

\hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level 2 Version 2. It is not available in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~1 nor in any version of Level 1.\hypertarget{class_initial_assignment_initassign-semantics}{}\subsection{Semantics of Initial Assignments}\label{class_initial_assignment_initassign-semantics}
The value calculated by an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} object overrides the value assigned to the given symbol by the object defining that symbol. For example, if a compartment\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} attribute is set in its definition, and the model also contains an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} having that compartment\textquotesingle{}s identifier as its \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{} attribute value, then the interpretation is that the \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} assigned in the \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object should be ignored and the value assigned based on the computation defined in the \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}. Initial assignments can take place for \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, global \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}, \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} (in Level~3), and S\+B\+ML Level~3 package elements (in Level~3 Version~2), regardless of the value of their \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute.

The actions of all \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} objects are in general terms the same, but differ in the precise details depending on the type of variable being set\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape In the case of a species}, an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} sets the referenced species\textquotesingle{} initial quantity (concentration or amount of substance) to the value determined by the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement. The overall units of the formula should (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in S\+B\+ML Level~3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same as the units specified for the species.


\item {\itshape In the case of a compartment}, an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} sets the referenced compartment\textquotesingle{}s initial size to the size determined by the formula in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. The overall units of the formula should (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in S\+B\+ML Level~3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same as the units specified for the size of the compartment.


\item {\itshape In the case of a parameter}, an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} sets the referenced parameter\textquotesingle{}s initial value to that determined by the formula in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. The overall units of the formula should (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and S\+B\+ML Level~3) or must (in previous Versions) be the same as the units defined for the parameter.


\item (For S\+B\+ML Level~3 only) {\itshape In the case of a species reference}, an initial assignment sets the initial value of the stoichiometry of the referenced reactant or product to the value determined by the formula in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. The unit associated with the value produced by the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula should be consistent with the unit \char`\"{}dimensionless\char`\"{}, because reactant and product stoichiometries in reactions are dimensionless quantities.


\item (For S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2 only) {\itshape In the case of an object from an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package}, an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} sets the referenced object\textquotesingle{}s initial value (however such values are defined by the package) to the value of the formula in math. The unit of measurement associated with the value produced by the formula should be the same as that object\textquotesingle{}s units attribute value (if it has such an attribute), or be equal to the units of model components of that type (if objects of that class are defined by the package as having the same units).


\end{DoxyItemize}

If the symbol attribute of an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} object references an object in an S\+B\+ML namespace that is not understood by the interpreter reading a given S\+B\+ML document (that is, if the object is defined by an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package that the software does not support), the assignment must be ignored--the object\textquotesingle{}s initial value will not need to be set, as the interpreter could not understand that package. If an interpreter cannot establish whether a referenced object is missing from the model or instead is defined in an S\+B\+ML namespace not understood by the interpreter, it may produce a warning to the user. (The latter situation may only arise if an S\+B\+ML package is present in the S\+B\+ML document with a package\+:required attribute of \char`\"{}true\char`\"{}.)

In the context of a simulation, initial assignments establish values that are in effect prior to and including the start of simulation time, i.\+e., {\itshape t $\leq$ 0}. Section 3.\+4.\+8 in the S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and S\+B\+ML Level~3 specifications provides information about the interpretation of assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time up to and including the start time {\itshape t = 0}; this is important for establishing the initial conditions of a simulation if the model involves expressions containing the {\itshape delay} \char`\"{}csymbol\char`\"{}.

There cannot be two initial assignments for the same symbol in a model; that is, a model must not contain two or more \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} objects that both have the same identifier as their \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{} attribute value. A model must also not define initial assignments {\itshape and} assignment rules for the same entity. That is, there cannot be {\itshape both} an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} and an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} for the same symbol in a model, because both kinds of constructs apply prior to and at the start of simulated time---allowing both to exist for a given symbol would result in indeterminism).

The ordering of \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} objects is not significant. The combined set of \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} objects form a set of assignment statements that must be considered as a whole. The combined set of assignment statements should not contain algebraic loops\+: a chain of dependency between these statements should terminate. (More formally, consider the directed graph of assignment statements where nodes are a model\textquotesingle{}s assignment statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of a symbol in an assignment statement \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} attribute. The directed arcs in this graph start from the statement assigning the symbol and end at the statement that contains the symbol in their math elements. Such a graph must be acyclic.)

Finally, it is worth being explicit about the expected behavior in the following situation. Suppose (1) a given symbol has a value {\itshape x} assigned to it in its definition, and (2) there is an initial assignment having the identifier as its \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{} value and reassigning the value to {\itshape y}, {\itshape and} (3) the identifier is also used in the mathematical formula of a second initial assignment. What value should the second initial assignment use? It is {\itshape y}, the value assigned to the symbol by the first initial assignment, not whatever value was given in the symbol\textquotesingle{}s definition. This follows directly from the behavior described above\+: if an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} object exists for a given symbol, then the symbol\textquotesingle{}s value is overridden by that initial assignment. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a1ad5a3548e75284b2645e4510fcb9ea2}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a1ad5a3548e75284b2645e4510fcb9ea2}}

\{core\} The rate expression for an S\+B\+ML reaction.

An object of class \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} is used to describe the rate at which the process defined by a given \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} takes place. \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} has subelements called \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} (for Math\+ML content) and \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Parameters\char`\"{} (of class \hyperlink{class_list_of_parameters}{List\+Of\+Parameters}), in addition to the attributes and subelements it inherits from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}.

\hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement for holding a Math\+ML formula (required through S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1, but optional as of S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2) defines the rate of the reaction. The formula may refer to other entities in a model as well as local parameter definitions within the scope of the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} (see below). It is important to keep in mind, however, that the only \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} identifiers that can be used in this formula are those declared in the lists of reactants, products and modifiers in the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} structure. (In other words, before a species can be referenced in the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}, it must be declared in one of those lists.)

\hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} provides a way to define {\itshape local} parameters whose identifiers can be used in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula of that \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} instance. Prior to S\+B\+ML Level~3, these parameter definitions are stored inside a \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Parameters\char`\"{} subelement containing \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} objects; in S\+B\+ML Level~3, this is achieved using a specialized object class called \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} and the containing subelement is called \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Local\+Parameters\char`\"{}. In both cases, the parameters so defined are only visible within the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} (or, as of S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, only visible within the parent \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}); they cannot be accessed outside. A local parameter within one reaction is not visible from within another reaction, nor is it visible to any other construct outside of the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} in which it is defined. In addition, another important feature is that if such a \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} (or in Level~3, \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter}) object has the same identifier as another object in the scope of the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}, the definition inside the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} takes precedence. In other words, within the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula, references to local parameter identifiers {\bfseries shadow any identical global identifiers}.

The values of local parameters defined within \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} objects cannot change. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, this quality is built into the \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} construct. In Level~2, where the same kind of \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} object class is used as for global parameters, the \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} objects\textquotesingle{} \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute must always have a value of {\ttfamily true} (either explicitly or left to its default value).\hypertarget{class_kinetic_law_shadowing-warning}{}\subsection{A warning about identifier shadowing}\label{class_kinetic_law_shadowing-warning}
A common misconception is that different classes of objects (e.\+g., species, compartments, parameters) in S\+B\+ML have different identifier scopes. They do not. The implication is that if a \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}\textquotesingle{}s local parameter definition uses an identifier identical to {\itshape any} other identifier defined in the model outside the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}, even if the other identifier does {\itshape not} belong to a parameter type of object, the local parameter\textquotesingle{}s identifier takes precedence within that \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula. It is not an error in S\+B\+ML for identifiers to shadow each other this way, but can lead to confusing and subtle errors.\hypertarget{class_kinetic_law_version-diffs}{}\subsection{S\+B\+M\+L Level/\+Version differences}\label{class_kinetic_law_version-diffs}
In S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~1, the S\+B\+ML specification included two additional attributes on \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} called \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{}. They were removed beginning with S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~2 because further research determined they introduced many problems. The most significant problem was that their use could easily lead to the creation of valid models whose reactions nevertheless could not be integrated into a system of equations without outside knowledge for converting the quantities used. Examination of real-\/life models revealed that a common reason for using \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} on \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} was to set the units of all reactions to the same set of substance units, something that is better achieved by using \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} to redefine {\ttfamily \char`\"{}substance\char`\"{}} for the whole \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}.

As mentioned above, in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Versions 2--4, local parameters are of class \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, the class of object is \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter}.

In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the scope of the \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} was expanded to the entire \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}, instead of just the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}. This introduced a single new restriction\+: an L3v2 \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} may not now shadow the {\ttfamily id} of any \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} referenced by a \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} in the same \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}. Other than that, there is no difference in any core construct. However, packages may take advantage of this new scope by adding elements to the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} that may now reference a \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} defined in the same \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a230968dbbf0e6dd9ae871b376484dbb7}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a230968dbbf0e6dd9ae871b376484dbb7}}

\{core\} Simple, plain, generic lists.



This class implements basic vanilla lists for lib\+S\+B\+ML. It was developed in the time before lib\+S\+B\+ML was converted to C++ and used C++ S\+TL library classes more extensively. At some point in the future, this \hyperlink{class_list}{List} class may be removed in favor of using standard C++ classes.

This class is distinct from \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of} because the latter is derived from the S\+B\+ML \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} class, whereas this \hyperlink{class_list}{List} class is not. \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of} can only be used when a list is actually intended to implement an S\+B\+ML List\+OfX class. This is why lib\+S\+B\+ML has both a \hyperlink{class_list}{List} and a \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of}. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a50a530a2ea1cab246381d98e1217c6cc}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a50a530a2ea1cab246381d98e1217c6cc}}

\{core\} Parent class for lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}\+List\+Of\+X\+Y\+Z\char`\"{} classes.



The \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of} class in lib\+S\+B\+ML is a utility class that serves as the parent class for implementing the List\+Of\+\_\+\+\_\+ classes. It provides methods for working generically with the various S\+B\+ML lists of objects in a program. Lib\+S\+B\+ML uses this separate list class rather than ordinary lists, so that it can provide the methods and features associated with \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}.

Whether a given \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of} element may be empty or not depends on the element in question, and on what level and version of S\+B\+ML it is being used for. For \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of} elements in S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1 and prior, no core list and few package lists could be empty. As of S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the rules were relaxed, and lists were allowed to be empty. In lib\+S\+B\+ML, documents created for Level~3 Version~2 will be written with empty \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of}\textquotesingle{}s if that \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of} contains some other \textquotesingle{}extra\textquotesingle{} information\+: an attribute such as metaid or sbo\+Term, a child \textquotesingle{}$<$notes$>$\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}$<$annotation$>$\textquotesingle{}, or information from a S\+B\+ML Level~3 package.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The various List\+Of\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+ classes in S\+B\+ML are merely containers used for organizing the main components of an S\+B\+ML model. In lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s implementation, List\+Of\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+ classes are derived from the intermediate utility class \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of}, which is not defined by the S\+B\+ML specifications but serves as a useful programmatic construct. \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of} is itself is in turn derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}, which provides all of the various List\+Of\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+ classes with common features defined by the S\+B\+ML specification, such as \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} attributes and annotations.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
The relationship between the lists and the rest of an S\+B\+ML model is illustrated by the following (for S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4)\+:



S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1 has essentially the same structure as Level~2 Version~4, depicted above, but S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2 allows containers to contain zero or more of the relevant object, instead of requiring at least one. As such, libsbml will write out an otherwise-\/empty List\+Of\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+ element that has any optional attribute set (such as \textquotesingle{}id\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}metaid\textquotesingle{}), that has an optional child (such as a \textquotesingle{}notes\textquotesingle{} or \textquotesingle{}annotation\textquotesingle{}), or that has attributes or children set from any S\+B\+ML Level~3 package, whether or not the List\+Of\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+ has any other children.

Readers may wonder about the motivations for using the List\+Of\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+ containers in S\+B\+ML. A simpler approach in X\+ML might be to place the components all directly at the top level of the model definition. The choice made in S\+B\+ML is to group them within X\+ML elements named after List\+Of{\itshape Classname}, in part because it helps organize the components. More importantly, the fact that the container classes are derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} means that software tools can add information {\itshape about} the lists themselves into each list container\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{}.

\{core\} A parameter inside an S\+B\+ML {\itshape reaction} definition.

\hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} has been introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~3 to serve as the object class for parameter definitions that are intended to be local to a \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}. Objects of class \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} never appear at the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} level; they are always contained within \hyperlink{class_list_of_local_parameters}{List\+Of\+Local\+Parameters} lists which are in turn contained within \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} objects.

Like its global \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} counterpart, the \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} object class is used to define a symbol associated with a value; this symbol can then be used in a model\textquotesingle{}s mathematical formulas (and specifically, for \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter}, reaction rate formulas). Unlike \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}, the \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} class does not have a \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute\+: local parameters within reactions are {\itshape always} constant.

\hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} has one required attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, to give the parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an S\+B\+ML model definition can refer to it. A parameter can also have an optional \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute of type {\ttfamily string}. Identifiers and names must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specifications.

The optional attribute \char`\"{}value\char`\"{} determines the value (of type {\ttfamily double}) assigned to the parameter. A missing value for \char`\"{}value\char`\"{} implies that the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an initial assignment. The unit of measurement associated with the value of the parameter can be specified using the optional attribute \char`\"{}units\char`\"{}. Here we only mention briefly some notable points about the possible unit choices, but readers are urged to consult the S\+B\+ML specification documents for more information\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In S\+B\+ML Level~3, there are no constraints on the units that can be assigned to parameters in a model; there are also no units to inherit from the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object.


\item In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the value assigned to the parameter\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute must be chosen from one of the following possibilities\+: one of the base unit identifiers defined in S\+B\+ML; one of the built-\/in unit identifiers {\ttfamily \char`\"{}substance\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}time\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}volume\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}area\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily \char`\"{}length\char`\"{}}; or the identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit definitions in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} structure. There are no constraints on the units that can be chosen from these sets. There are no default units for local parameters. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

As with all other major S\+B\+ML components, \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} is derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}, and the methods defined on \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} are available on \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter}.

In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the scope of the \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} was expanded slightly to officially encompass the entire \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} instead of just the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} in which it appears. This has no effect on models using only S\+B\+ML Level~3 Core constructs, but has the potential to allow S\+B\+ML Level~3 Packages to include elements in a \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} that could reference a \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} from that \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}. It also means that no \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} may have the same {\ttfamily \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}} as a referenced \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} in any \hyperlink{class_simple_species_reference}{Simple\+Species\+Reference} in that \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}.

\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML derives \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} from \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}; however, this does not precisely match the object hierarchy defined by S\+B\+ML Level~3, where \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} is derived directly from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} and not \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}. We believe this arrangement makes it easier for lib\+S\+B\+ML users to program applications that work with both S\+B\+ML Level~2 and S\+B\+ML Level~3, but programmers should also keep in mind this difference exists. A side-\/effect of lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s scheme is that certain methods on \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} that are inherited from \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} do not actually have relevance to \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter} objects. An example of this is the methods pertaining to \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}\textquotesingle{}s attribute \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} (i.\+e., is\+Set\+Constant(), set\+Constant(), and get\+Constant()).

\{core\} An S\+B\+ML model.

In an S\+B\+ML model definition, a single object of class \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} serves as the overall container for the lists of the various model components. All of the lists are optional, but if a given list container is present within the model, the list must not be empty; that is, it must have length one or more. The following are the components and lists permitted in different Levels and Versions of S\+B\+ML in version  of lib\+S\+B\+ML\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In S\+B\+ML Level 1, the components are\+: \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition}, \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}, \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule}, and \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}. Instances of the classes are placed inside instances of classes \hyperlink{class_list_of_unit_definitions}{List\+Of\+Unit\+Definitions}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_compartments}{List\+Of\+Compartments}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_species}{List\+Of\+Species}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_parameters}{List\+Of\+Parameters}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_rules}{List\+Of\+Rules}, and \hyperlink{class_list_of_reactions}{List\+Of\+Reactions}.


\item In S\+B\+ML Level 2 Version 1, the components are\+: \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition}, \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition}, \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}, \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule}, \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} and \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}. Instances of the classes are placed inside instances of classes \hyperlink{class_list_of_function_definitions}{List\+Of\+Function\+Definitions}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_unit_definitions}{List\+Of\+Unit\+Definitions}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_compartments}{List\+Of\+Compartments}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_species}{List\+Of\+Species}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_parameters}{List\+Of\+Parameters}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_rules}{List\+Of\+Rules}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_reactions}{List\+Of\+Reactions}, and \hyperlink{class_list_of_events}{List\+Of\+Events}.


\item In S\+B\+ML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4, the components are\+: \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition}, \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition}, \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type}, \hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type}, \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}, \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule}, \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint}, \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} and \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}. Instances of the classes are placed inside instances of classes \hyperlink{class_list_of_function_definitions}{List\+Of\+Function\+Definitions}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_unit_definitions}{List\+Of\+Unit\+Definitions}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_compartment_types}{List\+Of\+Compartment\+Types}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_species_types}{List\+Of\+Species\+Types}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_compartments}{List\+Of\+Compartments}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_species}{List\+Of\+Species}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_parameters}{List\+Of\+Parameters}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_initial_assignments}{List\+Of\+Initial\+Assignments}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_rules}{List\+Of\+Rules}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_constraints}{List\+Of\+Constraints}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_reactions}{List\+Of\+Reactions}, and \hyperlink{class_list_of_events}{List\+Of\+Events}.


\item In S\+B\+ML Level 3 Version 1, the components are\+: \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition}, \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition}, \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}, \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule}, \hyperlink{class_constraint}{Constraint}, \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} and \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}. Instances of the classes are placed inside instances of classes \hyperlink{class_list_of_function_definitions}{List\+Of\+Function\+Definitions}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_unit_definitions}{List\+Of\+Unit\+Definitions}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_compartments}{List\+Of\+Compartments}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_species}{List\+Of\+Species}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_parameters}{List\+Of\+Parameters}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_initial_assignments}{List\+Of\+Initial\+Assignments}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_rules}{List\+Of\+Rules}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_constraints}{List\+Of\+Constraints}, \hyperlink{class_list_of_reactions}{List\+Of\+Reactions}, and \hyperlink{class_list_of_events}{List\+Of\+Events}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

Although all the lists are optional, there are dependencies between S\+B\+ML components such that defining some components requires defining others. An example is that defining a species requires defining a compartment, and defining a reaction requires defining a species. The dependencies are explained in more detail in the S\+B\+ML specifications.

In addition to the above lists and attributes, the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} class in both S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3 has the usual two attributes of \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{}, and both are optional. As is the case for other S\+B\+ML components with \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attributes, they must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specifications. (Within the frameworks of S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3, a \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object identifier has no assigned meaning, but extension packages planned for S\+B\+ML Level~3 are likely to make use of this identifier.)

Finally, S\+B\+ML Level~3 has introduced a number of additional \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} attributes. They are discussed in a separate section below.\hypertarget{class_model_approaches}{}\subsection{Approaches to creating objects using the lib\+S\+B\+M\+L A\+PI}\label{class_model_approaches}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides two main mechanisms for creating objects\+: class constructors (e.\+g., Species\+::\+Species() ), and {\ttfamily create{\itshape Object}()} methods (such as Model\+::create\+Species()) provided by certain {\itshape Object} classes such as \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}. These multiple mechanisms are provided by lib\+S\+B\+ML for flexibility and to support different use-\/cases, but they also have different implications for the overall model structure.

In general, the recommended approach is to use the {\ttfamily create{\itshape Object}()} methods. These methods both create an object {\itshape and} link it to the parent in one step. Here is an example\+:

The {\ttfamily create{\itshape Object}()} methods return a pointer to the object created, but they also add the object to the relevant list of object instances contained in the parent. (These lists become the {\ttfamily $<$list\+Of{\itshape Object}s$>$} elements in the finished X\+ML rendition of S\+B\+ML.) In the example above, Model\+::create\+Species() adds the created species directly to the {\ttfamily $<$list\+Of\+Species$>$} list in the model. Subsequently, methods called on the species change the species in the model (which is what is expected in most situations).\hypertarget{class_model_model-checking}{}\subsection{Consistency and adherence to S\+B\+M\+L specifications}\label{class_model_model-checking}
To make it easier for applications to do whatever they need, lib\+S\+B\+ML version  is relatively lax when it comes to enforcing correctness and completeness of models {\itshape during} model construction and editing. Essentially, lib\+S\+B\+ML {\itshape will} {\itshape not} in most cases check automatically that a model\textquotesingle{}s components have valid attribute values, or that the overall model is consistent and free of errors---even obvious errors such as duplication of identifiers. This allows applications great leeway in how they build their models, but it means that software authors must take deliberate steps to ensure that the model will be, in the end, valid S\+B\+ML. These steps include such things as keeping track of the identifiers used in a model, manually performing updates in certain situations where an entity is referenced in more than one place (e.\+g., a species that is referenced by multiple \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} objects), and so on.

That said, lib\+S\+B\+ML does provide powerful features for deliberately performing validation of S\+B\+ML when an application decides it is time to do so. The interfaces to these facilities are on the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} class, in the form of S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Internal\+Consistency() and S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency(). Please refer to the documentation for \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} for more information about this.

While applications may play fast and loose and live like free spirits during the construction and editing of S\+B\+ML models, they should always make sure to call S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Internal\+Consistency() and/or S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency() before writing out the final version of an S\+B\+ML model.\hypertarget{class_model_model-l3-attrib}{}\subsection{Model attributes introduced in S\+B\+M\+L Level 3}\label{class_model_model-l3-attrib}
As mentioned above, the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} class has a number of optional attributes in S\+B\+ML Level~3. These are \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}volume\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}area\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}length\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}extent\+Units\char`\"{}, and "conversion\+Factor. The following provide more information about them.\hypertarget{class_model_model-l3-substanceunits}{}\subsubsection{The \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute}\label{class_model_model-l3-substanceunits}
The \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute is used to specify the unit of measurement associated with substance quantities of \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} objects that do not specify units explicitly. If a given \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object definition does not specify its unit of substance quantity via the \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute on the \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object instance, then that species inherits the value of the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute. If the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} does not define a value for this attribute, then there is no unit to inherit, and all species that do not specify individual \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute values then have {\itshape no} declared units for their quantities. The S\+B\+ML Level~3 specifications provide more details.

Note that when the identifier of a species appears in a model\textquotesingle{}s mathematical expressions, the unit of measurement associated with that identifier is {\itshape not solely determined} by setting \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} on \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} or \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}. Please see the discussion about units given in the documentation for the \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} class.\hypertarget{class_model_model-l3-timeunits}{}\subsubsection{The \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{} attribute}\label{class_model_model-l3-timeunits}
The \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{} attribute on S\+B\+ML Level~3\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object is used to specify the unit in which time is measured in the model. This attribute on \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} is the {\itshape only} way to specify a unit for time in a model. It is a global attribute; time is measured in the model everywhere in the same way. This is particularly relevant to \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} objects in a model\+: all \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} objects in S\+B\+ML define per-\/time values, and the unit of time is given by the \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{} attribute on the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object instance. If the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{} attribute has no value, it means that the unit of time is not defined for the model\textquotesingle{}s reactions and rate rules. Leaving it unspecified in an S\+B\+ML model does not result in an invalid model in S\+B\+ML Level~3; however, as a matter of best practice, we strongly recommend that all models specify units of measurement for time.\hypertarget{class_model_model-l3-voletc}{}\subsubsection{The \char`\"{}volume\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}area\+Units\char`\"{}, and \char`\"{}length\+Units\char`\"{} attributes}\label{class_model_model-l3-voletc}
The attributes \char`\"{}volume\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}area\+Units\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}length\+Units\char`\"{} together are used to set the units of measurements for the sizes of \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} objects in an S\+B\+ML Level~3 model when those objects do not otherwise specify units. The three attributes correspond to the most common cases of compartment dimensions\+: \char`\"{}volume\+Units\char`\"{} for compartments having a \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute value of {\ttfamily \char`\"{}3\char`\"{}}, \char`\"{}area\+Units\char`\"{} for compartments having a \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute value of {\ttfamily \char`\"{}2\char`\"{}}, and \char`\"{}length\+Units\char`\"{} for compartments having a \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute value of {\ttfamily \char`\"{}1\char`\"{}}. The attributes are not applicable to compartments whose \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute values are {\itshape not} one of {\ttfamily \char`\"{}1\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}2\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily \char`\"{}3\char`\"{}}.

If a given \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object instance does not provide a value for its \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute, then the unit of measurement of that compartment\textquotesingle{}s size is inherited from the value specified by the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} \char`\"{}volume\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}area\+Units\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}length\+Units\char`\"{} attribute, as appropriate based on the \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute value. If the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object does not define the relevant attribute, then there are no units to inherit, and all \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} objects that do not set a value for their \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute then have {\itshape no} units associated with their compartment sizes.

The use of three separate attributes is a carry-\/over from S\+B\+ML Level~2. Note that it is entirely possible for a model to define a value for two or more of the attributes \char`\"{}volume\+Units\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}area\+Units\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}length\+Units\char`\"{} simultaneously, because S\+B\+ML models may contain compartments with different numbers of dimensions.\hypertarget{class_model_model-l3-extentunits}{}\subsubsection{The \char`\"{}extent\+Units\char`\"{} attribute}\label{class_model_model-l3-extentunits}
Reactions are processes that occur over time. These processes involve events of some sort, where a single ``reaction event\textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{} is one in which some set of entities (known as reactants, products and modifiers in S\+B\+ML) interact, once. The {\itshape extent} of a reaction is a measure of how many times the reaction has occurred, while the time derivative of the extent gives the instantaneous rate at which the reaction is occurring. Thus, what is colloquially referred to as the \char`\"{}rate of the
   reaction\char`\"{} is in fact equal to the rate of change of reaction extent.

In S\+B\+ML Level~3, the combination of \char`\"{}extent\+Units\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{} defines the units of kinetic laws in S\+B\+ML and establishes how the numerical value of each \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object\textquotesingle{}s mathematical formula is meant to be interpreted in a model. The units of the kinetic laws are taken to be \char`\"{}extent\+Units\char`\"{} divided by \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{}.

Note that this embodies an important principle in S\+B\+ML Level~3 models\+: {\itshape all reactions in an S\+B\+ML model must have the same units} for the rate of change of extent. In other words, the units of all reaction rates in the model {\itshape must be the same}. There is only one global value for \char`\"{}extent\+Units\char`\"{} and one global value for \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{}.\hypertarget{class_model_model-l3-convfactor}{}\subsubsection{The \char`\"{}conversion\+Factor\char`\"{} attribute}\label{class_model_model-l3-convfactor}
The attribute \char`\"{}conversion\+Factor\char`\"{} in S\+B\+ML Level~3\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object defines a global value inherited by all \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object instances that do not define separate values for their \char`\"{}conversion\+Factor\char`\"{} attributes. The value of this attribute must refer to a \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} object instance defined in the model. The \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} object in question must be a constant; ie it must have its \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute value set to {\ttfamily \char`\"{}true\char`\"{}}.

If a given \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object definition does not specify a conversion factor via the \char`\"{}conversion\+Factor\char`\"{} attribute on \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, then the species inherits the conversion factor specified by the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} \char`\"{}conversion\+Factor\char`\"{} attribute. If the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} does not define a value for this attribute, then there is no conversion factor to inherit. More information about conversion factors is provided in the S\+B\+ML Level~3 specifications. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a9d370cd270581c2766a9ba1643f3a86d}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a9d370cd270581c2766a9ba1643f3a86d}}

\{core\} A reference to an S\+B\+ML {\itshape modifier species}.

Sometimes a species appears in the kinetic rate formula of a reaction but is itself neither created nor destroyed in that reaction (for example, because it acts as a catalyst or inhibitor). In S\+B\+ML, all such species are simply called {\itshape modifiers} without regard to the detailed role of those species in the model. The \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} structure provides a way to express which species act as modifiers in a given reaction. This is the purpose of the list of modifiers available in \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}. The list contains instances of \hyperlink{class_modifier_species_reference}{Modifier\+Species\+Reference} structures.

The \hyperlink{class_modifier_species_reference}{Modifier\+Species\+Reference} structure inherits the mandatory attribute \char`\"{}species\char`\"{} and optional attributes \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} from the parent class \hyperlink{class_simple_species_reference}{Simple\+Species\+Reference}. See the description of \hyperlink{class_simple_species_reference}{Simple\+Species\+Reference} for more information about these.

The value of the \char`\"{}species\char`\"{} attribute must be the identifier of a species defined in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}; this species is designated as a modifier for the current reaction. A reaction may have any number of modifiers. It is permissible for a modifier species to appear simultaneously in the list of reactants and products of the same reaction where it is designated as a modifier, as well as to appear in the list of reactants, products and modifiers of other reactions in the model. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_ad14c33c7af3841cf2196a44d69169944}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_ad14c33c7af3841cf2196a44d69169944}}

\{core\} An S\+B\+ML parameter\+: a named symbol with a value.

A \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} is used in S\+B\+ML to define a symbol associated with a value; this symbol can then be used in mathematical formulas in a model. By default, parameters have constant value for the duration of a simulation, and for this reason are called {\itshape parameters} instead of {\itshape variables} in S\+B\+ML, although it is crucial to understand that {\itshape S\+B\+ML parameters represent both concepts}. Whether a given S\+B\+ML parameter is intended to be constant or variable is indicated by the value of its \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute.

S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} has a required attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, that gives the parameter a unique identifier by which other parts of an S\+B\+ML model definition can refer to it. A parameter can also have an optional \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute of type {\ttfamily string}. Identifiers and names must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specifications.

The optional attribute \char`\"{}value\char`\"{} determines the value (of type {\ttfamily double}) assigned to the parameter. A missing value for \char`\"{}value\char`\"{} implies that the value either is unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an initial assignment. The unit of measurement associated with the value of the parameter can be specified using the optional attribute \char`\"{}units\char`\"{}. Here we only mention briefly some notable points about the possible unit choices, but readers are urged to consult the S\+B\+ML specification documents for more information\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In S\+B\+ML Level~3, there are no constraints on the units that can be assigned to parameters in a model; there are also no units to inherit from the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object (unlike the case for, e.\+g., \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} and \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}).


\item In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the value assigned to the parameter\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute must be chosen from one of the following possibilities\+: one of the base unit identifiers defined in S\+B\+ML; one of the built-\/in unit identifiers {\ttfamily \char`\"{}substance\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}time\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}volume\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}area\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily \char`\"{}length\char`\"{}}; or the identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit definitions in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} structure. There are no constraints on the units that can be chosen from these sets. There are no default units for parameters. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

The \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} structure has another boolean attribute named \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} that is used to indicate whether the parameter\textquotesingle{}s value can vary during a simulation. (In S\+B\+ML Level~3, the attribute is mandatory and must be given a value; in S\+B\+ML Levels below Level~3, the attribute is optional.) A value of {\ttfamily true} indicates the parameter\textquotesingle{}s value cannot be changed by any construct except \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}. Conversely, if the value of \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} is {\ttfamily false}, other constructs in S\+B\+ML, such as rules and events, can change the value of the parameter.

S\+B\+ML Level~3 uses a separate object class, \hyperlink{class_local_parameter}{Local\+Parameter}, for parameters that are local to a \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}. In Levels prior to S\+B\+ML Level~3, the \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} class is used both for definitions of global parameters, as well as reaction-\/local parameters stored in a list within \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} objects. \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} objects that are local to a reaction (that is, those defined within the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} structure of a \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}) cannot be changed by rules and therefore are {\itshape implicitly always constant}; consequently, in S\+B\+ML Level~2, parameter definitions within \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} structures should {\itshape not} have their \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute set to {\ttfamily false}.

What if a global parameter has its \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute set to {\ttfamily false}, but the model does not contain any rules, events or other constructs that ever change its value over time? Although the model may be suspect, this situation is not strictly an error. A value of {\ttfamily false} for \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} only indicates that a parameter {\itshape can} change value, not that it {\itshape must}.

As with all other major S\+B\+ML components, \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} is derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}, and the methods defined on \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} are available on \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The use of the term {\itshape parameter} in S\+B\+ML sometimes leads to confusion among readers who have a particular notion of what something called \char`\"{}parameter\char`\"{} should be. It has been the source of heated debate, but despite this, no one has yet found an adequate replacement term that does not have different connotations to different people and hence leads to confusion among {\itshape some} subset of users. Perhaps it would have been better to have two constructs, one called {\itshape constants} and the other called {\itshape variables}. The current approach in S\+B\+ML is simply more parsimonious, using a single \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} construct with the boolean flag \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} indicating which flavor it is. In any case, readers are implored to look past their particular definition of a {\itshape parameter} and simply view S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} as a single mechanism for defining both constants and (additional) variables in a model. (We write {\itshape additional} because the species in a model are usually considered to be the central variables.) After all, software tools are not required to expose to users the actual names of particular S\+B\+ML constructs, and thus tools can present to their users whatever terms their designers feel best matches their target audience.
\end{DoxyNote}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, many restrictions were lifted requiring only Boolean values in Boolean contexts, and numeric values in numeric contexts. This means that a \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} may now be used as a Boolean, despite canonically having a numeric value. To be consistent, one should always assign it a value of {\ttfamily true} or {\ttfamily false}, and use it in Boolean contexts exclusively. It would be appropriate to give it an \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} value of 602 (\textquotesingle{}Logical parameter\textquotesingle{}) if one chooses to do this.

\{core\} The priority of execution of an S\+B\+ML {\itshape event}.

The \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} object class (which was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1), like \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay}, is derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} and contains a Math\+ML formula stored in the element \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. This formula is used to compute a dimensionless numerical value that influences the order in which a simulator is to perform the assignments of two or more events that happen to be executed simultaneously. The formula may evaluate to any {\ttfamily double} value (and thus may be a positive or negative number, or zero), with positive numbers taken to signifying a higher priority than zero or negative numbers. If no \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} object is present on a given \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object, no priority is defined for that event.\hypertarget{class_priority_priority-interp}{}\subsection{The interpretation of priorities on events in a model}\label{class_priority_priority-interp}
For the purposes of S\+B\+ML, {\itshape simultaneous event execution} is defined as the situation in which multiple events have identical times of execution. The time of execution is calculated as the sum of the time at which a given event\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} is {\itshape triggered} plus its \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} duration, if any. Here, {\itshape identical times} means {\itshape mathematically equal} instants in time. (In practice, simulation software adhering to this specification may have to rely on numerical equality instead of strict mathematical equality; robust models will ensure that this difference will not cause significant discrepancies from expected behavior.)

If no \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} subobjects are defined for two or more \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} objects, then those events are still executed simultaneously but their order of execution is {\itshape undefined by the S\+B\+ML Level~3 specification}. A software implementation may choose to execute such simultaneous events in any order, as long as each event is executed only once and the requirements of checking the \char`\"{}persistent\char`\"{} attribute (and acting accordingly) are satisfied.

If \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} subobjects are defined for two or more simultaneously-\/triggered events, the order in which those particular events must be executed is dictated by their \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} objects, as follows. If the values calculated using the two \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} objects\textquotesingle{} \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expressions differ, then the event having the higher priority value must be executed before the event with the lower value. If, instead, the two priority values are mathematically equal, then the two events must be triggered in a {\itshape random} order. It is important to note that a {\itshape random order is not the same as an undefined order}\+: given multiple runs of the same model with identical conditions, an undefined ordering would permit a system to execute the events in (for example) the same order every time (according to whatever scheme may have been implemented by the system), whereas the explicit requirement for random ordering means that the order of execution in different simulation runs depends on random chance. In other words, given two events {\itshape A} and {\itshape B}, a randomly-\/determined order must lead to an equal chance of executing {\itshape A} first or {\itshape B} first, every time those two events are executed simultaneously.

A model may contain a mixture of events, some of which have \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} subobjects and some do not. Should a combination of simultaneous events arise in which some events have priorities defined and others do not, the set of events with defined priorities must trigger in the order determined by their \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} objects, and the set of events without \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} objects must be executed in an {\itshape undefined} order with respect to each other and with respect to the events with \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} subobjects. (Note that {\itshape undefined order} does not necessarily mean random order, although a random ordering would be a valid implementation of this requirement.)

The following example may help further clarify these points. Suppose a model contains four events that should be executed simultaneously, with two of the events having \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} objects with the same value and the other two events having \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} objects with the same, but different, value. The two events with the higher priorities must be executed first, in a random order with respect to each other, and the remaining two events must be executed after them, again in a random order, for a total of four possible and equally-\/likely event executions\+: A-\/\+B-\/\+C-\/D, A-\/\+B-\/\+D-\/C, B-\/\+A-\/\+C-\/D, and B-\/\+A-\/\+D-\/C. If, instead, the model contains four events all having the same \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} values, there are 4! or 24 possible orderings, each of which must be equally likely to be chosen. Finally, if none of the four events has a \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} subobject defined, or even if exactly one of the four events has a defined \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority}, there are again 24 possible orderings, but the likelihood of choosing any particular ordering is undefined; the simulator can choose between events as it wishes. (The S\+B\+ML specification only defines the effects of priorities on \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} objects with respect to {\itshape other} \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} objects with priorities. Putting a priority on a {\itshape single} \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object in a model does not cause it to fall within that scope.)\hypertarget{class_priority_priority-eval}{}\subsection{Evaluation of Priority expressions}\label{class_priority_priority-eval}
An event\textquotesingle{}s \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} object \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expression must be evaluated at the time the \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} is to be {\itshape executed}. During a simulation, all simultaneous events have their \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} values calculated, and the event with the highest priority is selected for next execution. Note that it is possible for the execution of one \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object to cause the \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} value of another simultaneously-\/executing \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object to change (as well as to trigger other events, as already noted). Thus, after executing one event, and checking whether any other events in the model have been triggered, all remaining simultaneous events that {\itshape either} (i) have \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} objects with attributes \char`\"{}persistent\char`\"{}={\ttfamily false} {\itshape or} (ii) have \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} expressions that did not transition from {\ttfamily true} to {\ttfamily false}, must have their \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} expression reevaluated. The highest-\/priority remaining event must then be selected for execution next.\hypertarget{class_priority_priority-units}{}\subsection{Units of Priority object\textquotesingle{}s mathematical expressions}\label{class_priority_priority-units}
The unit associated with the value of a \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expression should be {\ttfamily dimensionless}. This is because the priority expression only serves to provide a relative ordering between different events, and only has meaning with respect to other \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} object expressions. The value of \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} objects is not comparable to any other kind of object in an S\+B\+ML model.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} construct exists only in S\+B\+ML Level~3; it cannot be used in S\+B\+ML Level~2 or Level~1 models.

\hypertarget{class_priority_priority-restrictions}{}\subsection{Restrictions relaxed in S\+B\+M\+L Level 3 Version 2}\label{class_priority_priority-restrictions}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the requirement that a \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} have a \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement was relaxed, making it optional. In this case, the \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority} remains undefined, and unless that information is provided in some other form (such as with an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package), the \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} behaves as if it had no \hyperlink{class_priority}{Priority}.

\{core\} An S\+B\+ML {\itshape rate rule} representing {\itshape dx/dt = f({\bfseries Y})}.

The rule type \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} is derived from the parent class \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule}. It is used to express equations that determine the rates of change of variables. The left-\/hand side (the \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute) can refer to the identifier of a species, compartment, or parameter (but not a reaction). The entity identified must have its \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute set to {\ttfamily false}. The effects of a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} are in general terms the same, but differ in the precise details depending on which variable is being set\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape In the case of a species}, a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} sets the rate of change of the species\textquotesingle{} quantity ({\itshape concentration} or {\itshape amount of substance}) to the value determined by the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement of the \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} object. The overall units of the formula in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} {\itshape should} (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in S\+B\+ML Level~3) or {\itshape must} (in S\+B\+ML releases prior to Level~2 version~4) be equal to the unit of {\itshape species quantity} divided by the model-\/wide unit of {\itshape time}. {\itshape Restrictions}\+: There must not be both a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute and a \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} \char`\"{}species\char`\"{} attribute having the same value, unless that species has its \char`\"{}boundary\+Condition\char`\"{} attribute is set to {\ttfamily true}. This means a rate rule cannot be defined for a species that is created or destroyed in a reaction, unless that species is defined as a boundary condition in the model.


\item (For S\+B\+ML Level~3 only) {\itshape In the case of a species reference}, a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} sets the rate of change of the stoichiometry of the referenced reactant or product to the value determined by the formula in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. The unit associated with the value produced by the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} formula should be consistent with the unit \char`\"{}dimensionless\char`\"{} divided by the model-\/wide unit of {\itshape time}.


\item {\itshape In the case of a compartment}, a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} sets the rate of change of the compartment\textquotesingle{}s size to the value determined by the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement of the \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} object. The overall units of the formula {\itshape should} (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in S\+B\+ML Level~3) or {\itshape must} (in S\+B\+ML releases prior to Level~2 version~4) be the units of the compartment\textquotesingle{}s {\itshape size} divided by the model-\/wide unit of {\itshape time}.


\item {\itshape In the case of a parameter}, a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} sets the rate of change of the parameter\textquotesingle{}s value to that determined by the formula in the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement of the \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} object. The overall units of the formula {\itshape should} (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 and in S\+B\+ML Level~3) or {\itshape must} (in S\+B\+ML releases prior to Level~2 version~4) be the \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}unit\char`\"{} attribute value divided by the model-\/wide unit of {\itshape time}.


\item (For S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2 only) {\itshape In the case of an object from an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package}, a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} sets the rate of change of the referenced object\textquotesingle{}s value (as defined by that package) to the value of the formula in \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}. The unit of measurement associated with the value produced by the formula should be the same as that object\textquotesingle{}s units attribute value (if it has such an attribute) divided by the model-\/wide unit of {\itshape time}, or be equal to the units of model components of that type (if objects of that class are defined by the package as having the same units) divided by the model-\/wide unit of {\itshape time}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

In S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3 Version~1, the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement of the \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} is required. In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, this rule is relaxed, and the subelement is optional. If a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} with no \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} child is present in the model, the rate at which its referenced \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} changes over time is undefined. This may represent a situation where the model itself is unfinished, or the missing information may be provided by an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package.

If the variable attribute of a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} object references an object in an S\+B\+ML namespace that is not understood by the interpreter reading a given S\+B\+ML document (that is, if the object is defined by an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package that the software does not support), the rate rule must be ignored--the object\textquotesingle{}s value will not need to be set, as the interpreter could not understand that package. If an interpreter cannot establish whether a referenced object is missing from the model or instead is defined in an S\+B\+ML namespace not understood by the interpreter, it may produce a warning to the user. (The latter situation may only arise if an S\+B\+ML package is present in the S\+B\+ML document with a package\+:required attribute of \char`\"{}true\char`\"{}.)

In the context of a simulation, rate rules are in effect for simulation time {\itshape t} $>$ {\itshape 0}. Please consult the relevant S\+B\+ML specification for additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules, and entity values for simulation time {\itshape t} $\leq$ {\itshape 0}.

As mentioned in the description of \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, a model must not contain more than one \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} object having the same value of \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}; in other words, in the set of all assignment rules and rate rules in an S\+B\+ML model, each variable appearing in the left-\/hand sides can only appear once. This simply follows from the fact that an indeterminate system would result if a model contained more than one assignment rule for the same variable or both an assignment rule and a rate rule for the same variable.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-general}{}\subsection{General summary of S\+B\+M\+L rules}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-general}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3 as well as Level~2, rules are separated into three subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software. The three subclasses are based on the following three different possible functional forms (where {\itshape x} is a variable, {\itshape f} is some arbitrary function returning a numerical result, {\bfseries {\itshape V}} is a vector of variables that does not include {\itshape x}, and {\bfseries {\itshape W}} is a vector of variables that may include {\itshape x})\+:

\tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu} spread 0pt [c]{*{3}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
{\itshape Algebraic\+:}&left-\/hand side is zero&{\itshape 0 = f({\bfseries W})} \\\cline{1-3}
{\itshape Assignment\+:}&left-\/hand side is a scalar\+:&{\itshape x = f({\bfseries V})} \\\cline{1-3}
{\itshape Rate\+:}&left-\/hand side is a rate-\/of-\/change\+:&{\itshape dx/dt = f({\bfseries W})} \\\cline{1-3}
\end{longtabu}


In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish between {\itshape assignment} and {\itshape algebraic} rules. They are treated as separate cases for the following reasons\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Assignment} rules can simply be evaluated to calculate intermediate values for use in numerical methods. They are statements of equality that hold at all times. (For assignments that are only performed once, see \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}.)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+B\+ML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of general algebraic equations;\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Those simulators that {\itshape can} solve these algebraic equations make a distinction between the different categories listed above; and\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable to models that do not contain {\itshape algebraic} rules.\end{DoxyItemize}
The approach taken to covering these cases in S\+B\+ML is to define an abstract \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} structure containing a subelement, \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}, to hold the right-\/hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} that add attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate rules. The \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement must contain a Math\+ML expression defining the mathematical formula of the rule. This Math\+ML formula must return a numerical value. The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the variables and other entities in an S\+B\+ML model.

Each of the three subclasses of \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} (\hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule}) inherit the the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement and other fields from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}. The \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} classes add an additional attribute, \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}. See the definitions of \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-restrictions}{}\subsection{Additional restrictions on S\+B\+M\+L rules}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-restrictions}
An important design goal of S\+B\+ML rule semantics is to ensure that a model\textquotesingle{}s simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or how often rules are evaluated. To achieve this, S\+B\+ML needs to place two restrictions on rule use. The first concerns algebraic loops in the system of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-no-loops}{}\subsubsection{A model must not contain algebraic loops}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-no-loops}
The combined set of \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be considered as a whole. (A \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object is counted as an assignment because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attribute of the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} object in which it is defined.) This combined set of assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate. To put this more formally, consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an S\+B\+ML species, compartment or parameter symbol in an assignment statement\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement. Let the directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the statements that contain the symbol in their \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement expressions. This graph must be acyclic.

Similarly, the combined set of \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} objects constitute a set of definitions for the rates of change of various model entities (namely, the objects identified by the values of the \textquotesingle{}variable\textquotesingle{} attributes of the \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} objects, and the \textquotesingle{}species\textquotesingle{} attributes of the \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} objects in each \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}). In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, these rates of change may be referenced directly using the {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol, but may not thereby contain algebraic loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate. More formally, consider a directed graph in which the nodes are the definitions of different variables\textquotesingle{} rates of change, and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of a variable referenced by a {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol from any \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object in the model. Let the directed arcs point from the variable referenced by the {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol (call it {\itshape x}) to the variable(s) determined by the \textquotesingle{}math\textquotesingle{} expression in which {\itshape x} appears. This graph must be acyclic.

S\+B\+ML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated. Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations changing. As an example, consider the set of equations {\itshape x = x + 1}, {\itshape y = z + 200} and {\itshape z = y + 100}. If this set of equations were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid because the rule for {\itshape x} refers to {\itshape x} (exhibiting one type of loop), and the rule for {\itshape y} refers to {\itshape z} while the rule for {\itshape z} refers back to {\itshape y} (exhibiting another type of loop). Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of assignment statements\+: {\itshape x = 10}, {\itshape y = z + 200}, and {\itshape z = x
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 100.
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape  An S\+B\+ML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not define more equations than there are unknowns in a model. A valid S\+B\+ML model that does not contain \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} structures cannot be overdetermined.}

{\itshape  Lib\+S\+B\+ML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix~B of the S\+B\+ML Level~3 specification for assessing whether a model is overdetermined.}

{\itshape  (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic, mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model. One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the equations. Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system are linked to the equations that determine them. For algebraic equations, there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the equation. For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that differential equation. A mathematical model is overdetermined if the maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes representing equations. If one maximal matching has this property, then all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.\+e., it is only necessary to find one maximal matching.)}

\{core\} An S\+B\+ML reaction between species in an S\+B\+ML model.

A {\itshape reaction} represents any transformation, transport or binding process, typically a chemical reaction, that can change the quantity of one or more species. In S\+B\+ML, a reaction is defined primarily in terms of the participating reactants and products (and their corresponding stoichiometries), along with optional modifier species, an optional rate at which the reaction takes place, and optional parameters.

As with other major objects in S\+B\+ML, \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} has a mandatory attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, used to give the compartment type an identifier. The identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax permitted in S\+B\+ML. In S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3, the reaction \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} identifier can be used in mathematical formulas elsewhere in an S\+B\+ML model to represent the rate of that reaction; this usage is explained below. \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} also has an optional \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute, of type {\ttfamily string}. The \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specification.

The species participating as reactants, products, and/or modifiers in a reaction are declared using lists of \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} and/or \hyperlink{class_modifier_species_reference}{Modifier\+Species\+Reference} instances stored in subelements \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Reactants\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Products\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Modifiers\char`\"{}. Certain restrictions are placed on the appearance of species in reaction definitions\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The ability of a species to appear as a reactant or product of any reaction in a model is governed by certain flags in that species\textquotesingle{} definition; see the definition of \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} for more information.


\item Any species appearing in the mathematical formula of the subelement \char`\"{}kinetic\+Law\char`\"{} (described below) of a \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} must be declared in at least one of that \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}\textquotesingle{}s lists of reactants, products, and/or modifiers. Put another way, it is an error for a reaction\textquotesingle{}s kinetic law formula to refer to species that have not been declared for that reaction.


\item For S\+B\+ML Levels 1, 2, and S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1, a reaction definition can contain an empty list of reactants {\itshape or} an empty list of products, but it must have at least one reactant or product; in other words, a reaction without any reactant or product species is not permitted. (This restriction does not apply to modifier species, which remain optional in all cases.) In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, this requirement was dropped, allowing the creation of reactions with neither reactants nor products. 
\end{DoxyItemize}

A reaction can contain up to one \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object in a subelement named \char`\"{}kinetic\+Law\char`\"{}. It defines the speed at which the process defined by the reaction takes place. The description of \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} provides more details about its use. Note that although the inclusion of a \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object in an instance of a \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} component is optional, there is no useful default that can be substituted in place of a missing rate expression in a reaction. Moreover, a reaction\textquotesingle{}s rate cannot be defined in any other way in S\+B\+ML---\hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}, and other constructs in S\+B\+ML cannot be used to set the reaction rate separately. Nevertheless, for some modeling applications, reactions without any defined rate can be perfectly acceptable.

\hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} also has a boolean attribute named \char`\"{}reversible\char`\"{} for indicating whether the reaction is reversible. This attribute is optional in S\+B\+ML Level~2, with a default of {\ttfamily true}; it is mandatory in S\+B\+ML Level~3 (with no default value). To say that a reaction is {\itshape reversible} is to say it can proceed in either the forward or the reverse direction. Although the reversibility of a reaction can sometimes be deduced by inspecting its rate expression, this is not always the case, especially for complicated expressions. Moreover, the need in S\+B\+ML to allow rate expressions (i.\+e., \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}) to be optional leads to the need for a separate flag indicating reversibility. Note that labeling a reaction as irreversible is an assertion that the reaction always proceeds in the given forward direction. (Why else would it be flagged as irreversible?) This implies the rate expression in the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} always has a non-\/negative value during simulations. Software tools could provide a means of optionally testing that this condition holds. The presence of reversibility information in two places (i.\+e., the rate expression and the \char`\"{}reversible\char`\"{} attribute on \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}) leaves open the possibility that a model could contain contradictory information, but the creation of such a model would be an error on the part of the software generating it.

The \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} object class has another boolean attribute called \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{}. This attribute is optional in S\+B\+ML Level~2, with a default of {\ttfamily false}; it is mandatory in S\+B\+ML Level~3 (with no default value). In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, a value of {\ttfamily true} for the \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{} attribute is deprecated in favor of all reactions having a \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{} value of {\ttfamily false}. It is used to indicate that a reaction occurs on a vastly faster time scale than others in a system. Readers are directed to the S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 specification, which provides more detail about the conditions under which a reaction can be considered to be fast in this sense. S\+B\+ML Level~1 and Level~2 Version~1 incorrectly claimed that software tools could ignore this attribute if they did not implement support for the corresponding concept; however, further research in S\+B\+ML has revealed that this is not true, and \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{} {\itshape cannot be ignored} if it is set to {\ttfamily true}. S\+B\+ML Level~2 Versions~2--4 therefore stipulate that if a model has any reactions with \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{} set to {\ttfamily true}, a software tool must be able to respect the attribute or else indicate to the user that it does not have the capacity to do so. Analysis software cannot ignore the value of the \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{} attribute because doing so may lead to different results as compared to a software system that {\itshape does} make use of \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{}.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, values of {\ttfamily true} for the \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{} attribute were deprecated, and in future versions of the specification, the attribute itself will be removed. Users should be aware that even for previous levels/versions of the specification, the \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{} attribute has never achieved widespread support, and many software packages may ignore it. To achieve the same or similar effects as setting the fast attribute to \char`\"{}true\char`\"{} for a given reaction, the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} attribute should be constructed to produce a value in the desired time scale, or else the reaction could be replaced with an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3, the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} object has an additional optional attribute named \char`\"{}compartment\char`\"{}, whose value must be the identifier of a compartment defined in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object. The \char`\"{}compartment\char`\"{} attribute can be used to indicate the compartment in which the reaction is assumed to take place. If the attribute is present, its value must be the identifier of a \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object defined in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object. Similar to the \char`\"{}reversible\char`\"{} attribute, the value of the \char`\"{}compartment\char`\"{} attribute has no direct impact on the construction of mathematical equations for the S\+B\+ML model. When a kinetic law is given for a reaction, the compartment location may already be implicit in the kinetic law (although this cannot always be guaranteed). Nevertheless, software tools may find the \char`\"{}compartment\char`\"{} attribute value useful for such purposes as analyzing the structure of the model, guiding the modeler in constructing correct rate formulas, and visualization purposes.

Readers are urged to read the S\+B\+ML specification for more details about the proper use of \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a9c1aaebf476b2eb6573435d710826f0b}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a9c1aaebf476b2eb6573435d710826f0b}}

\{core\} Parent class for S\+B\+ML {\itshape rules} in lib\+S\+B\+ML.

In S\+B\+ML, {\itshape rules} provide additional ways to define the values of variables in a model, their relationships, and the dynamical behaviors of those variables. They enable encoding relationships that cannot be expressed using \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} nor \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} objects alone.

The lib\+S\+B\+ML implementation of rules mirrors the S\+B\+ML Level~3 definition (which is in turn is very similar to the Level~2 Version~4 definition), with \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} being the parent class of three subclasses as explained below. The \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} class itself cannot be instantiated by user programs and has no constructor; only the subclasses \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} can be instantiated directly.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-general}{}\subsection{General summary of S\+B\+M\+L rules}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-general}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3 as well as Level~2, rules are separated into three subclasses for the benefit of model analysis software. The three subclasses are based on the following three different possible functional forms (where {\itshape x} is a variable, {\itshape f} is some arbitrary function returning a numerical result, {\bfseries {\itshape V}} is a vector of variables that does not include {\itshape x}, and {\bfseries {\itshape W}} is a vector of variables that may include {\itshape x})\+:

\tabulinesep=1mm
\begin{longtabu} spread 0pt [c]{*{3}{|X[-1]}|}
\hline
{\itshape Algebraic\+:}&left-\/hand side is zero&{\itshape 0 = f({\bfseries W})} \\\cline{1-3}
{\itshape Assignment\+:}&left-\/hand side is a scalar\+:&{\itshape x = f({\bfseries V})} \\\cline{1-3}
{\itshape Rate\+:}&left-\/hand side is a rate-\/of-\/change\+:&{\itshape dx/dt = f({\bfseries W})} \\\cline{1-3}
\end{longtabu}


In their general form given above, there is little to distinguish between {\itshape assignment} and {\itshape algebraic} rules. They are treated as separate cases for the following reasons\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Assignment} rules can simply be evaluated to calculate intermediate values for use in numerical methods. They are statements of equality that hold at all times. (For assignments that are only performed once, see \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}.)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+B\+ML needs to place restrictions on assignment rules, for example the restriction that assignment rules cannot contain algebraic loops.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some simulators do not contain numerical solvers capable of solving unconstrained algebraic equations, and providing more direct forms such as assignment rules may enable those simulators to process models they could not process if the same assignments were put in the form of general algebraic equations;\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Those simulators that {\itshape can} solve these algebraic equations make a distinction between the different categories listed above; and\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Some specialized numerical analyses of models may only be applicable to models that do not contain {\itshape algebraic} rules.\end{DoxyItemize}
The approach taken to covering these cases in S\+B\+ML is to define an abstract \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} structure containing a subelement, \char`\"{}math\char`\"{}, to hold the right-\/hand side expression, then to derive subtypes of \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} that add attributes to distinguish the cases of algebraic, assignment and rate rules. The \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement must contain a Math\+ML expression defining the mathematical formula of the rule. This Math\+ML formula must return a numerical value. The formula can be an arbitrary expression referencing the variables and other entities in an S\+B\+ML model.

Each of the three subclasses of \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} (\hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule}) inherit the the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement and other fields from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}. The \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} classes add an additional attribute, \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}. See the definitions of \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} for details about the structure and interpretation of each one.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-restrictions}{}\subsection{Additional restrictions on S\+B\+M\+L rules}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-restrictions}
An important design goal of S\+B\+ML rule semantics is to ensure that a model\textquotesingle{}s simulation and analysis results will not be dependent on when or how often rules are evaluated. To achieve this, S\+B\+ML needs to place two restrictions on rule use. The first concerns algebraic loops in the system of assignments in a model, and the second concerns overdetermined systems.\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-no-loops}{}\subsubsection{A model must not contain algebraic loops}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-no-loops}
The combined set of \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} objects in a model constitute a set of assignment statements that should be considered as a whole. (A \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object is counted as an assignment because it assigns a value to the symbol contained in the \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attribute of the \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} object in which it is defined.) This combined set of assignment statements must not contain algebraic loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate. To put this more formally, consider a directed graph in which nodes are assignment statements and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of an S\+B\+ML species, compartment or parameter symbol in an assignment statement\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement. Let the directed arcs point from the statement assigning the symbol to the statements that contain the symbol in their \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement expressions. This graph must be acyclic.

Similarly, the combined set of \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} objects constitute a set of definitions for the rates of change of various model entities (namely, the objects identified by the values of the \textquotesingle{}variable\textquotesingle{} attributes of the \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} objects, and the \textquotesingle{}species\textquotesingle{} attributes of the \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} objects in each \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}). In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, these rates of change may be referenced directly using the {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol, but may not thereby contain algebraic loops---dependency chains between these statements must terminate. More formally, consider a directed graph in which the nodes are the definitions of different variables\textquotesingle{} rates of change, and directed arcs exist for each occurrence of a variable referenced by a {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol from any \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} object in the model. Let the directed arcs point from the variable referenced by the {\itshape rate\+Of} csymbol (call it {\itshape x}) to the variable(s) determined by the \textquotesingle{}math\textquotesingle{} expression in which {\itshape x} appears. This graph must be acyclic.

S\+B\+ML does not specify when or how often rules should be evaluated. Eliminating algebraic loops ensures that assignment statements can be evaluated any number of times without the result of those evaluations changing. As an example, consider the set of equations {\itshape x = x + 1}, {\itshape y = z + 200} and {\itshape z = y + 100}. If this set of equations were interpreted as a set of assignment statements, it would be invalid because the rule for {\itshape x} refers to {\itshape x} (exhibiting one type of loop), and the rule for {\itshape y} refers to {\itshape z} while the rule for {\itshape z} refers back to {\itshape y} (exhibiting another type of loop). Conversely, the following set of equations would constitute a valid set of assignment statements\+: {\itshape x = 10}, {\itshape y = z + 200}, and {\itshape z = x
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item 100.
\end{DoxyItemize}}

{\itshape }\hypertarget{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-not-overdetermined}{}\subsubsection{A model must not be overdetermined}\label{classdoc__rules__general__summary_rules-not-overdetermined}
{\itshape  An S\+B\+ML model must not be overdetermined; that is, a model must not define more equations than there are unknowns in a model. A valid S\+B\+ML model that does not contain \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} structures cannot be overdetermined.}

{\itshape  Lib\+S\+B\+ML implements the static analysis procedure described in Appendix~B of the S\+B\+ML Level~3 specification for assessing whether a model is overdetermined.}

{\itshape  (In summary, assessing whether a given continuous, deterministic, mathematical model is overdetermined does not require dynamic analysis; it can be done by analyzing the system of equations created from the model. One approach is to construct a bipartite graph in which one set of vertices represents the variables and the other the set of vertices represents the equations. Place edges between vertices such that variables in the system are linked to the equations that determine them. For algebraic equations, there will be edges between the equation and each variable occurring in the equation. For ordinary differential equations (such as those defined by rate rules or implied by the reaction rate definitions), there will be a single edge between the equation and the variable determined by that differential equation. A mathematical model is overdetermined if the maximal matchings of the bipartite graph contain disconnected vertexes representing equations. If one maximal matching has this property, then all the maximal matchings will have this property; i.\+e., it is only necessary to find one maximal matching.)}

\{core\} S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s {\itshape S\+Base} class, base class of most S\+B\+ML objects.

Most components in S\+B\+ML are derived from a single abstract base type, \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}. In addition to serving as the parent class for most other classes of objects in S\+B\+ML, this base type is designed to allow a modeler or a software package to attach arbitrary information to each major element or list in an S\+B\+ML model.

\hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} has an optional subelement called \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{}. It is intended to serve as a place for storing optional information intended to be seen by humans. An example use of the \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} element would be to contain formatted user comments about the model element in which the \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} element is enclosed. There are certain conditions on the X\+H\+T\+ML content permitted inside the \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} element; please consult the \href{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications}{\tt S\+B\+ML specification document} corresponding to the S\+B\+ML Level and Version of your model for more information about the requirements for \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} content.

\hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} has another optional subelement called \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{}. Whereas the \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} element described above is a container for content to be shown directly to humans, the \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} element is a container for optional software-\/generated content {\itshape not} meant to be shown to humans. The element\textquotesingle{}s content type is \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#elemdecls}{\tt X\+ML type \char`\"{}any\char`\"{}}, allowing essentially arbitrary data content. S\+B\+ML places only a few restrictions on the organization of the content; these are intended to help software tools read and write the data as well as help reduce conflicts between annotations added by different tools. As is the case with \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{}, it is important to refer to the \href{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications}{\tt S\+B\+ML specification document} corresponding to the S\+B\+ML Level and Version of your model for more information about the requirements for \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} content.

It is worth pointing out that the \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} element in the definition of \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} exists in order that software developers may attach optional application-\/specific data to the elements in an S\+B\+ML model. However, it is important that this facility not be misused. In particular, it is {\itshape critical} that data essential to a model definition or that can be encoded in existing S\+B\+ML elements is {\itshape not} stored in \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{}. \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} values, functional dependencies between model elements, etc., should not be recorded as annotations. It is crucial to keep in mind the fact that data placed in annotations can be freely ignored by software applications. If such data affects the interpretation of a model, then software interoperability is greatly impeded.

S\+B\+ML Level 2 introduced an optional \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} attribute named \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} for supporting metadata annotations using R\+DF (\href{http://www.w3.org/RDF/}{\tt Resource Description Format}). The attribute value has the data type \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id}{\tt X\+ML ID}, the X\+ML identifier type, which means each \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} value must be globally unique within an S\+B\+ML file. (Importantly, this uniqueness criterion applies across any attribute with type \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id}{\tt X\+ML ID}, not just the \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} attribute used by S\+B\+ML---something to be aware of if your application-\/specific X\+ML content inside the \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} subelement happens to use \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id}{\tt X\+ML ID}.) The \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} value serves to identify a model component for purposes such as referencing that component from metadata placed within \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} subelements.

Beginning with S\+B\+ML Level 2 Version 3, \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} also has an optional attribute named \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} for supporting the use of the Systems Biology Ontology. In S\+B\+ML proper, the data type of the attribute is a string of the form \char`\"{}\+S\+B\+O\+:\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\char`\"{}, where \char`\"{}\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\char`\"{} is a seven digit integer number; lib\+S\+B\+ML simplifies the representation by only storing the \char`\"{}\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\+N\char`\"{} integer portion. Thus, in lib\+S\+B\+ML, the \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} attribute on \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} has data type {\ttfamily int}, and \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} identifiers are stored simply as integers. (For convenience, \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} offers methods for returning both the integer form and a text-\/string form of the \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} identifier.) \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} terms are a type of optional annotation, and each different class of S\+B\+ML object derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} imposes its own requirements about the values permitted for \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{}. Please consult the S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 specification for more information about the use of \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} and the \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} attribute.

Finally, note that, in the list of methods on \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}, there is no public constructor because \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} is an abstract class. The constructors reside in the subclasses derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}.\hypertarget{class_s_base_sbase-miriam}{}\subsection{Standard format for annotations linking data resources}\label{class_s_base_sbase-miriam}
S\+B\+ML Level 2 Versions 2, 3 and 4, and Level~3, define a proposed regular format for encoding two particular categories of annotations\+: (a) references to controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers which define and describe biological and biochemical entities in a model; and (b) descriptions of the provenance of a model, including its author(s) and modification history. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_abd77ac159580a10a8628f0e02cc26168}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_abd77ac159580a10a8628f0e02cc26168}}

This class is used as part of the mechanism that connects plugin objects (implemented using \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin}{S\+Base\+Plugin} or \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document_plugin}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+Plugin}) to a given package extension.

The use of \hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{S\+Base\+Extension\+Point} is relatively straightforward. The class needs to be used for each extended S\+B\+ML object implemented using \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document_plugin}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+Plugin} or \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin}{S\+Base\+Plugin}. Doing so requires knowing just two things\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The short-\/form name of the {\itshape parent} package being extended. The parent package is often simply core S\+B\+ML, identified in lib\+S\+B\+ML by the nickname {\ttfamily \char`\"{}core\char`\"{}}, but a S\+B\+ML Level~3 package could conceivably extend another Level~3 package.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The lib\+S\+B\+ML type code assigned to the object being extended. For example, if an extension of \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} is implemented, the relevant type code is S\+B\+M\+L\+Type\+Code\+\_\+t\+::\+S\+B\+M\+L\+\_\+\+M\+O\+D\+EL, found in \hyperlink{_s_b_m_l_type_codes_8h_aa283dddfd7671179362b2f38e2938cfe}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Type\+Code\+\_\+t}.\end{DoxyItemize}
The typical use of \hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{S\+Base\+Extension\+Point} is illustrated by the following code fragment\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{SBaseExtensionPoint} docExtPoint(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"core"}, \hyperlink{_s_b_m_l_type_codes_8h_aa283dddfd7671179362b2f38e2938cfeabfe976c674a5a708c1373dfdfa3bfa63}{SBML\_DOCUMENT});
\hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{SBaseExtensionPoint} modelExtPoint(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"core"}, \hyperlink{_s_b_m_l_type_codes_8h_aa283dddfd7671179362b2f38e2938cfea3c866be107d7858b6dd1e978ed103028}{SBML\_MODEL});

\hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin_creator}{SBasePluginCreator<GroupsSBMLDocumentPlugin, GroupsExtension>}
       docPluginCreator(docExtPoint, pkgURIs);
\hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin_creator}{SBasePluginCreator<GroupsModelPlugin, GroupsExtension>}
       modelPluginCreator(modelExtPoint, pkgURIs);
\end{DoxyCode}


The code above shows two core S\+B\+ML components being extended\+: the document object, and the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object. These extended objects are created elsewhere (not shown) as the {\ttfamily Groups\+S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+Plugin} and {\ttfamily Groups\+Model\+Plugin} objects. The corresponding \hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{S\+Base\+Extension\+Point} objects are handed as arguments to the constructor for \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin_creator}{S\+Base\+Plugin\+Creator} to create the connection between the extended core components and the overall package extension (here, for the Groups package, with the {\ttfamily Groups\+Extension} object).

The code above is typically placed in the implementation of the {\ttfamily init()} method of the package class derived from \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension}. (For the example above, it would be in the {\ttfamily Groups\+Extension.\+cpp} file.) \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_af21a43ce74e3088eaf144dd60c2bca5f}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_af21a43ce74e3088eaf144dd60c2bca5f}}

\{core\} Overall S\+B\+ML container object.

When creating fresh models programmatically, the starting point is typically the creation of an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object instance. The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} constructor accepts arguments for the S\+B\+ML Level and Version of the model to be created. After creating the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object, calling programs then typically call S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::create\+Model() almost immediately, and then proceed to call the methods on the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object to fill out the model\textquotesingle{}s contents.

\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} corresponds roughly to the class {\itshape Sbml} defined in the S\+B\+ML Level~2 specification and {\itshape S\+B\+ML} in the Level~3 specification. It does not have a direct correspondence in S\+B\+ML Level~1. (However, to make matters simpler for applications, lib\+S\+B\+ML creates an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} no matter whether the model is Level~1, Level~2 or Level~3.) In its barest form, when written out in X\+ML format for (e.\+g.) S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4, the corresponding structure is the following\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<sbml xmlns="http://www.sbml.org/sbml/level2/version4" level="2" version="4">
  ...
</sbml>\end{DoxyVerb}


\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} is derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base}, and therefore contains the usual \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} attributes (in S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3) of \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{}, as well as the subelements \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{}. It also contains the attributes \char`\"{}level\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}version\char`\"{} indicating the Level and Version of the S\+B\+ML data structure. These can be accessed using the methods defined by the \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} class for that purpose.\hypertarget{class_s_b_m_l_document_checking}{}\subsection{Checking consistency and adherence to S\+B\+M\+L specifications}\label{class_s_b_m_l_document_checking}
One of the most important features of lib\+S\+B\+ML is its ability to perform S\+B\+ML validation to ensure that a model adheres to the S\+B\+ML specification for whatever Level+\+Version combination the model uses. \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} provides the methods for running consistency-\/checking and validation rules on the S\+B\+ML content.

First, a brief explanation of the rationale is in order. In lib\+S\+B\+ML versions up to and including the version~3.\+3.\+x series, the individual methods for creating and setting attributes and other components were quite lenient, and allowed a caller to compose S\+B\+ML entities that might not, in the end, represent valid S\+B\+ML. This allowed applications the freedom to do things such as save incomplete models (which is useful when models are being developed over long periods of time). In the version~4.\+x series, lib\+S\+B\+ML is somewhat stricter, but still permits structures to be created independently and the results to be combined in a separate step. In all these cases, it means that a separate validation step is necessary when a calling program finally wants to finish a complete S\+B\+ML document.

The primary interface to this validation facility is \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document}\textquotesingle{}s S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Internal\+Consistency() and S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency(). The former verifies the basic internal consistency and syntax of an S\+B\+ML document, and the latter implements more elaborate validation rules (both those defined by the S\+B\+ML specifications, as well as additional rules offered by lib\+S\+B\+ML).

These methods have slightly different relevance depending on whether a model is created programmaticaly from scratch, or whether it is read in from a file or data stream. The following list summarizes the possible scenarios.

{\itshape Scenario 1\+: Creating a model from scratch}. Before writing out the model,

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Call S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Internal\+Consistency(), then inquire about the results by calling S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Num\+Errors()\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Call S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::set\+Consistency\+Checks() to configure which checks will be performed by S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency()\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Call S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency(), then inquire about the results by calling S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Num\+Errors()\end{DoxyItemize}
{\itshape Scenario 2\+: Reading a model from a file or data stream.} After reading the model,

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Basic consistency checks will have been performed automatically by lib\+S\+B\+ML upon reading the content, so you only need to inquire about the results by using S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Num\+Errors()\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Call S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::set\+Consistency\+Checks() to configure which checks are performed by S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency()\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Call S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency(), then inquire about the results by calling S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Num\+Errors()\end{DoxyItemize}
It should be noted that as of S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} became an optional child of \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document}, instead of being required. This means that one can no longer use S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Model() as a cheap method of checking if an S\+B\+ML document was read in properly\+: the more robust get\+Error methods detailed above must be used instead.\hypertarget{class_s_b_m_l_document_converting}{}\subsection{Converting documents between Levels and Versions of S\+B\+ML}\label{class_s_b_m_l_document_converting}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides facilities for limited translation of S\+B\+ML between Levels and Versions of the S\+B\+ML specifications. The method for doing is is set\+Level\+And\+Version() . In general, models can be converted upward without difficulty (e.\+g., from S\+B\+ML Level~1 to Level~2, or from an earlier Version of Level~2 to the latest Version of Level~2). Sometimes models can be translated downward as well, if they do not use constructs specific to more advanced Levels of S\+B\+ML.

Calling S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::set\+Level\+And\+Version() will not {\itshape necessarily} lead to a successful conversion. The method will return a boolean value to indicate success or failure. Callers must check the error log (see next section) attached to the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object after calling S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::set\+Level\+And\+Version() in order to assess whether any problems arose.

If an application is interested in translating to a lower Level and/or Version of S\+B\+ML within a Level, the following methods allow for prior assessment of whether there is sufficient compatibility to make a translation possible\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+L1\+Compatibility(), \item S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+L2v1\+Compatibility(), \item S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+L2v2\+Compatibility(), \item S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+L2v3\+Compatibility(), \item S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+L2v4\+Compatibility(), \item S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+L2v5\+Compatibility(), and \item S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+L3v1\+Compatibility().\end{DoxyItemize}
Some changes between Versions of S\+B\+ML Level~2 may lead to unexpected behaviors when attempting conversions in either direction. For example, S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4 relaxed the requirement for consistency in units of measurement between expressions annd quantities in a model. As a result, a model written in Version~4, if converted to Version~3 with no other changes, may fail validation as a Version~3 model because Version~3 imposed stricter requirements on unit consistency.

Other changes between S\+B\+ML Level 2 and Level 3 make downward conversions challenging. In some cases, it means that a model converted to Level~2 from Level~3 will contain attributes that were not explicitly given in the Level~3 model, because in Level~2 these attributes may have been optional or have default values.\hypertarget{class_s_b_m_l_document_errors}{}\subsection{Error handling}\label{class_s_b_m_l_document_errors}
Upon reading a model, \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} logs any problems encountered while reading the model from the file or data stream. The log contains objects that record diagnostic information about any notable issues that arose. Whether the problems are warnings or errors, they are both reported through a single common interface involving the object class \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error}.

The methods S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Num\+Errors(), S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Error() and S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::print\+Errors() allow callers to interact with the warnings or errors logged. Alternatively, callers may retrieve the entire log as an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} object using the method S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Error\+Log(). The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} object provides some alternative methods for interacting with the set of errors and warnings. In either case, applications typically should first call S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Num\+Errors() to find out if any issues have been logged after specific lib\+S\+B\+ML operations such as the ones discussed in the sections above. If they have, then an application will should proceed to inspect the individual reports using either the direct interfaces on \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} or using the methods on the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} object. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a68f3c87cfe35c9e412b1a80002870a07}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a68f3c87cfe35c9e412b1a80002870a07}}

\{core\} Base class for extending \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} in packages.



The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document_plugin}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+Plugin} class is a specialization of \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin}{S\+Base\+Plugin} designed specifically for extending \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document}. All package extensions must extend \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} to implement support for S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages; these extensions can be subclasses of this class or from a derived class of this class.

All packages must additionally define a required flag named {\ttfamily required}, which indicates whether that package\textquotesingle{}s constructs can be used to change the core mathematics of the {\ttfamily $<$model$>$} child of the {\ttfamily $<$sbml$>$} element. If they can, this attribute must be set {\ttfamily true}, and if they cannot, this attribute must be set {\ttfamily false}.\hypertarget{classdoc__basics__of__extensions_ext-basics}{}\subsection{Basic principles of S\+B\+M\+L package extensions in lib\+S\+B\+ML}\label{classdoc__basics__of__extensions_ext-basics}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
S\+B\+ML Level~3\textquotesingle{}s package structure permits modular extensions to the core S\+B\+ML format. In lib\+S\+B\+ML, support for S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages is provided through optional {\itshape package extensions} that can be plugged into lib\+S\+B\+ML at the time it is built/compiled. Users of lib\+S\+B\+ML can thus choose which extensions are enabled in their software applications.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML defines a number of classes that developers of package extensions can use to implement support for an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package. These classes make it easier to extend lib\+S\+B\+ML objects with new attributes and/or subobjects as needed by a particular Level~3 package. Three overall categories of classes make up lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s facilities for implementing package extensions. There are (1) classes that serve as base classes meant to be subclassed, (2) template classes meant to be instantiated rather than subclassed, and (3) support classes that provide utility features. A given package implementation for lib\+S\+B\+ML will take the form of code using these and other lib\+S\+B\+ML classes, placed in a subdirectory of {\ttfamily src/sbml/packages/}.

The basic lib\+S\+B\+ML distribution includes a number of package extensions implementing support for officially-\/endorsed S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages; among these are {\itshape Flux Balance Constraints} (\char`\"{}fbc\char`\"{}), {\itshape Hierarchical Model Composition} (\char`\"{}comp\char`\"{}), {\itshape Layout} (\char`\"{}layout\char`\"{}), and {\itshape Qualitative Models} (\char`\"{}qual\char`\"{}). They can serve as working examples for developers working to implement other packages.

Extensions in lib\+S\+B\+ML can currently only be implemented in C++ or C; there is no mechanism to implement them first in languages such as Java or Python. However, once implemented in C++ or C, language interfaces can be generated semi-\/automatically using the framework in place in lib\+S\+B\+ML. (The approach is based on using \href{http://www.swig.org}{\tt S\+W\+IG} and facilities in lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s build system.) \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a5d9a211dd5836342706bb25212097d40}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a5d9a211dd5836342706bb25212097d40}}

\{core\} An error, warning or other diagnostic.



When a lib\+S\+B\+ML operation on S\+B\+ML content results in an error, or when there is something wrong with the S\+B\+ML content, the problems are reported as \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} objects. These are generally stored in an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} object; this log object, in turn, is kept in the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object containing the S\+B\+ML content. Applications can obtain the list of logged errors using S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Error\+Log() and then use the methods provided by \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} to access individual \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} objects. (Note that despite the word \char`\"{}error\char`\"{} in the name, \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} objects are used to represent not only \char`\"{}true\char`\"{} errors, but also warnings and some informational diagnostics. The name is a historical hold-\/over from early versions of lib\+S\+B\+ML, in which the object really was only used to report errors.)

Error codes are useful mainly for software. For human readers, \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} also includes text messages that describe the nature of a given problem. The messages can be accessed using S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Short\+Message() and S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Message(). The former provides a brief one-\/line description of the issue, while S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Message() provides a more detailed text, including (if appropriate) references to sections of the S\+B\+ML specifications where relevant topics are discussed. These text strings are suitable for displaying to human users.

In addition, \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} also has a severity code. Its value may be retrieved using the method S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Severity(). The possible severity values are the same as those reported by Severity levels currently range from informational (\{L\+I\+B\+S\+B\+M\+L\+\_\+\+S\+E\+V\+\_\+\+I\+N\+FO, X\+M\+L\+Error\+Severity\+\_\+t\}) to fatal errors (\{L\+I\+B\+S\+B\+M\+L\+\_\+\+S\+E\+V\+\_\+\+F\+A\+T\+AL, X\+M\+L\+Error\+Severity\+\_\+t\}). They can be used by an application to evaluate how serious a given problem is.

\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} also tracks the Level~3 package extension, if any, was responsible for a given warning or error. Each diagnostic code logged by an lib\+S\+B\+ML extension for S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages includes a record of the package that logged it. It can be retrieved using S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Package(). The information is a simple text string; the string will be the nickname of the package, such as {\ttfamily \char`\"{}comp\char`\"{}} for the Hierarchical Model Composition package, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}fbc\char`\"{}} for the Flux Balance Constraints package, and so on. If the value returned by S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Package() is an empty string or has the value {\ttfamily \char`\"{}core\char`\"{}}, then the error came from lib\+S\+B\+ML core.

Finally, \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} records the line and column near where the problem occurred in the S\+B\+ML content. The values may be retrieved using the methods S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Line() and S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Column(). We say \char`\"{}near\char`\"{}, because a lot of factors affect how accurate the line/column information ultimately is. For example, different X\+ML parsers have different conventions for which line and column number they report for a particular problem (which makes a difference when a problem involves an opening X\+ML tag on one line and a closing tag on another line). In some situations, some parsers report invalid line and/or column numbers altogether. If this occurs, lib\+S\+B\+ML sets the line and/or column number in the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} object to the the value of the maximum unsigned long integer representable on the platform where lib\+S\+B\+ML is running. (This is equal to the constant named {\ttfamily U\+L\+O\+N\+G\+\_\+\+M\+AX} in C and C++.) The probability that a true line or column number in an S\+B\+ML model would equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application encounters these values in an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} object, it can assume no valid line/column number could be provided by lib\+S\+B\+ML in that situation.

The text shown in the \char`\"{}\+Meaning\char`\"{} is the text returned by the S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Short\+Message() method on a given \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} object. A longer and (hopefully) clearer explanation of the issue is returned by S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Message().

The error codes come from different lists depending on whether they\textquotesingle{}re from lib\+S\+B\+ML core or from an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package extension. However, in the language interfaces other than C++, all lib\+S\+B\+ML error codes are ultimately represented as integer constants rather than separate enumerations lists, and they are all stored in a single interface class. Codes from different lib\+S\+B\+ML extensions have names that begin with the package\textquotesingle{}s nickname, such as {\ttfamily Qual} for the Qualitative Models package, {\ttfamily Layout} for the Layout package, and so on. If the name of a code does not begin with one of the package nicknames ({\ttfamily Layout}, {\ttfamily Fbc}, {\ttfamily Comp}, {\ttfamily Qual}, etc.), then it is a code from lib\+S\+B\+ML core. \begin{DoxyParagraph}{}

\{core\} Base class for S\+B\+ML Level 3 package plug-\/ins.



The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension} class is a component of the lib\+S\+B\+ML package extension mechanism. It is an abstract class that is extended by each package extension implementation.\hypertarget{classdoc__basics__of__extensions_ext-basics}{}\subsection{Basic principles of S\+B\+M\+L package extensions in lib\+S\+B\+ML}\label{classdoc__basics__of__extensions_ext-basics}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
S\+B\+ML Level~3\textquotesingle{}s package structure permits modular extensions to the core S\+B\+ML format. In lib\+S\+B\+ML, support for S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages is provided through optional {\itshape package extensions} that can be plugged into lib\+S\+B\+ML at the time it is built/compiled. Users of lib\+S\+B\+ML can thus choose which extensions are enabled in their software applications.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML defines a number of classes that developers of package extensions can use to implement support for an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package. These classes make it easier to extend lib\+S\+B\+ML objects with new attributes and/or subobjects as needed by a particular Level~3 package. Three overall categories of classes make up lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s facilities for implementing package extensions. There are (1) classes that serve as base classes meant to be subclassed, (2) template classes meant to be instantiated rather than subclassed, and (3) support classes that provide utility features. A given package implementation for lib\+S\+B\+ML will take the form of code using these and other lib\+S\+B\+ML classes, placed in a subdirectory of {\ttfamily src/sbml/packages/}.

The basic lib\+S\+B\+ML distribution includes a number of package extensions implementing support for officially-\/endorsed S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages; among these are {\itshape Flux Balance Constraints} (\char`\"{}fbc\char`\"{}), {\itshape Hierarchical Model Composition} (\char`\"{}comp\char`\"{}), {\itshape Layout} (\char`\"{}layout\char`\"{}), and {\itshape Qualitative Models} (\char`\"{}qual\char`\"{}). They can serve as working examples for developers working to implement other packages.

Extensions in lib\+S\+B\+ML can currently only be implemented in C++ or C; there is no mechanism to implement them first in languages such as Java or Python. However, once implemented in C++ or C, language interfaces can be generated semi-\/automatically using the framework in place in lib\+S\+B\+ML. (The approach is based on using \href{http://www.swig.org}{\tt S\+W\+IG} and facilities in lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s build system.)\hypertarget{class_s_b_m_l_extension_sbmlextension-l2-special}{}\subsection{Special handling for S\+B\+M\+L Level 2}\label{class_s_b_m_l_extension_sbmlextension-l2-special}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Due to the historical background of the S\+B\+ML Layout package, lib\+S\+B\+ML implements special behavior for that package\+: it {\itshape always} creates a Layout plugin object for any S\+B\+ML Level~2 document it reads in, regardless of whether that document actually uses Layout constructs. This is unlike the case for S\+B\+ML Level~3 documents that use Layout; for them, lib\+S\+B\+ML will {\itshape not} create a plugin object unless the document actually declares the use of the Layout package (via the usual Level~3 namespace declaration for Level~3 packages).
\end{DoxyParagraph}
This has the following consequence. If an application queries for the presence of Layout in an S\+B\+ML Level~2 document by testing only for the existence of the plugin object, {\bfseries it will always get a positive result}; in other words, the presence of a Layout extension object is not an indication of whether a read-\/in Level~2 document does or does not use S\+B\+ML Layout. Instead, callers have to query explicitly for the existence of layout information. An example of such a query is the following code\+:

The special, always-\/available Level~2 Layout behavior was motivated by a desire to support legacy applications. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, the Layout package uses the normal S\+B\+ML Level~3 scheme of requiring declarations on the S\+B\+ML document element. This means that upon reading a model, lib\+S\+B\+ML knows right away whether it contains layout information. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, there is no top-\/level declaration because layout is stored as annotations in the body of the model. Detecting the presence of layout information when reading a Level~2 model requires parsing the annotations. For efficiency reasons, lib\+S\+B\+ML normally does not parse annotations automatically when reading a model. However, applications that predated the introduction of Level~3 Layout and the updated version of lib\+S\+B\+ML never had to do anything special to enable parsing layout; the facilities were always available for every Level~2 model as long as lib\+S\+B\+ML was compiled with Layout support. To avoid burdening developers of legacy applications with the need to modify their software, lib\+S\+B\+ML provides backward compatibility by always preloading the Layout package extension when reading Level~2 models. The same applies to the creation of Level~2 models\+: with the plugin-\/oriented lib\+S\+B\+ML, applications normally would have to take deliberate steps to activate package code, instantiate objects, manage namespaces, and so on. Lib\+S\+B\+ML again loads the Layout package plugin automatically when creating a Level~2 model, thereby making the A\+P\+Is available to legacy applications without further work on their part. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a4e00a7bb511a1e92fc80cc501829ce10}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a4e00a7bb511a1e92fc80cc501829ce10}}

It is extended from \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} and is meant to be used by package extensions to store the S\+B\+ML Level, Version within a Level, and package version of the S\+B\+ML Level~3 package implemented by a lib\+S\+B\+ML package extension.\hypertarget{classdoc__basics__of__extensions_ext-basics}{}\subsection{Basic principles of S\+B\+M\+L package extensions in lib\+S\+B\+ML}\label{classdoc__basics__of__extensions_ext-basics}

\{core\} Set of S\+B\+ML Level + Version + namespace triples.



There are differences in the definitions of components between different S\+B\+ML Levels, as well as Versions within Levels. For example, the \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} attribute was not introduced until Level~2 Version~2, and then only on certain component classes; the S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~3 specification moved the \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} attribute to the \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} class, thereby allowing nearly all components to have \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} annotations. As a result of differences such as those, lib\+S\+B\+ML needs to track the S\+B\+ML Level and Version of every object created.

The purpose of the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object class is to make it easier to communicate S\+B\+ML Level and Version data between lib\+S\+B\+ML constructors and other methods. The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object class tracks 3-\/tuples (triples) consisting of S\+B\+ML Level, Version, and the corresponding S\+B\+ML X\+ML namespace.

The plural name (\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces}) is not a mistake, because in S\+B\+ML Level~3, objects may have extensions added by Level~3 packages used by a given model and therefore may have multiple namespaces associated with them; however, until the introduction of S\+B\+ML Level~3, the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object only records one S\+B\+ML Level/\+Version/namespace combination at a time. Most constructors for S\+B\+ML objects in lib\+S\+B\+ML take a \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object as an argument, thereby allowing the constructor to produce the proper combination of attributes and other internal data structures for the given S\+B\+ML Level and Version. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_ab72ed507d5be020ac1e261c525aa599c}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_ab72ed507d5be020ac1e261c525aa599c}}

\{core\} File and text-\/string S\+B\+ML reader.



The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reader}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader} class provides the main interface for reading S\+B\+ML content from files and strings. The methods for reading S\+B\+ML all return an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object representing the results. In the case of failures (such as if the S\+B\+ML contains errors or a file cannot be read), the errors will be recorded with the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} object kept in the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} returned by \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reader}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader}. Consequently, immediately after calling a method on \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reader}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader}, callers should always check for errors and warnings using the methods for this purpose provided by \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document}.

For convenience as well as easy access from other languages besides C++, this file also defines two global functions, \{read\+S\+B\+ML, String\} and \{read\+S\+B\+M\+L\+From\+String, String\}. They are equivalent to creating an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reader}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader} object and then calling the and methods, respectively.\hypertarget{class_s_b_m_l_reader_compression}{}\subsection{Support for reading compressed files}\label{class_s_b_m_l_reader_compression}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides support for reading (as well as writing) compressed S\+B\+ML files. The process is transparent to the calling application---the application does not need to do anything deliberate to invoke the functionality. If a given S\+B\+ML filename ends with an extension for the {\itshape gzip}, {\itshape zip} or {\itshape bzip2} compression formats (respectively, {\ttfamily }.gz, {\ttfamily }.zip, or {\ttfamily }.bz2), then the methods and

will automatically decompress and compress the file while reading and writing it. If the filename has no such extension, it will be read and written uncompressed as normal.

The compression feature requires that the {\itshape zlib} (for {\itshape gzip} and {\itshape zip} formats) and/or {\itshape bzip2} (for {\itshape bzip2} format) be available on the system running lib\+S\+B\+ML, and that lib\+S\+B\+ML was configured with their support compiled-\/in. Please see the lib\+S\+B\+ML \href{libsbml-installation.html}{\tt installation instructions} for more information about this. The methods has\+Zlib() and has\+Bzip2() can be used by an application to query at run-\/time whether support for the compression libraries is available in the present copy of lib\+S\+B\+ML.

Support for compression is not mandated by the S\+B\+ML standard, but applications may find it helpful, particularly when large S\+B\+ML models are being communicated across data links of limited bandwidth. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a715c227342dd5fbe68ace7d4933cf043}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a715c227342dd5fbe68ace7d4933cf043}}

\{core\} An S\+B\+ML {\itshape species} -- a pool of entities.

A {\itshape species} in S\+B\+ML refers to a pool of entities that (a) are considered indistinguishable from each other for the purposes of the model, (b) participate in reactions, and (c) are located in a specific {\itshape compartment}. The S\+B\+ML \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object class is intended to represent these pools.

As with other major constructs in S\+B\+ML, \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} has a mandatory attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, used to give the species type an identifier in the model. The identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax permitted in S\+B\+ML. \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} also has an optional \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute, of type {\ttfamily string}. The \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specifications.

The required attribute \char`\"{}compartment\char`\"{} is used to identify the compartment in which the species is located. The attribute\textquotesingle{}s value must be the identifier of an existing \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object. It is important to note that there is no default value for the \char`\"{}compartment\char`\"{} attribute on \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}; every species in an S\+B\+ML model must be assigned a compartment {\itshape explicitly}. (This also implies that every model with one or more \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} objects must define at least one \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object.)\hypertarget{class_species_species-amounts}{}\subsection{The initial amount and concentration of a species}\label{class_species_species-amounts}
The optional attributes \char`\"{}initial\+Amount\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}initial\+Concentration\char`\"{}, both having a data type of {\ttfamily double}, can be used to set the {\itshape initial} quantity of the species in the compartment where the species is located. These attributes are mutually exclusive; i.\+e., {\itshape only one} can have a value on any given instance of a \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object. Missing \char`\"{}initial\+Amount\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}initial\+Concentration\char`\"{} values implies that their values either are unknown, or to be obtained from an external source, or determined by an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} or other S\+B\+ML construct elsewhere in the model.

A species\textquotesingle{} initial quantity in S\+B\+ML is set by the \char`\"{}initial\+Amount\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}initial\+Concentration\char`\"{} attribute exactly once. If the \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute is {\ttfamily true}, then the value of the species\textquotesingle{} quantity is fixed and cannot be changed except by an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}. These methods differ in that the \char`\"{}initial\+Amount\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}initial\+Concentration\char`\"{} attributes can only be used to set the species quantity to a literal floating-\/point number, whereas the use of an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} object allows the value to be set using an arbitrary mathematical expression (which, thanks to Math\+ML\textquotesingle{}s expressiveness, may evaluate to a rational number). If the species\textquotesingle{} \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute is {\ttfamily false}, the species\textquotesingle{} quantity value may be overridden by an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} or changed by \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}, and in addition, for {\itshape t $>$ 0}, it may also be changed by a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} objects, and as a result of being a reactant or product in one or more \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} objects. (However, some constructs are mutually exclusive; see the S\+B\+ML specifications for the precise details.) It is not an error to define \char`\"{}initial\+Amount\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}initial\+Concentration\char`\"{} on a species and also redefine the value using an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, but the \char`\"{}initial\+Amount\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}initial\+Concentration\char`\"{} setting in that case is ignored. The S\+B\+ML specifications provide additional information about the semantics of assignments, rules and values for simulation time {\itshape t} $\leq$ {\itshape 0}.

S\+B\+ML Level~2 additionally stipulates that in cases where a species\textquotesingle{} compartment has a \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} value of {\ttfamily 0} (zero), the species cannot have a value for \char`\"{}initial\+Concentration\char`\"{} because the concepts of concentration and density break down when a container has zero dimensions.\hypertarget{class_species_species-units}{}\subsection{The units of a species\textquotesingle{} amount or concentration}\label{class_species_species-units}
When the attribute \char`\"{}initial\+Amount\char`\"{} is set, the unit of measurement associated with the value of \char`\"{}initial\+Amount\char`\"{} is specified by the \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} attribute \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{}. When the \char`\"{}initial\+Concentration\char`\"{} attribute is set, the unit of measurement associated with this concentration value is \{{\itshape unit of amount}\} divided by \{{\itshape unit of size}\}, where the \{{\itshape unit of amount}\} is specified by the \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute, and the \{{\itshape unit of size}\} is specified by the \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute of the \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object in which the species is located. Note that in either case, a unit of {\itshape amount} is involved and determined by the \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute. Note {\bfseries these two attributes alone do not determine the units of the species when the species identifier appears in a mathematical expression}; {\itshape that} aspect is determined by the attribute \char`\"{}has\+Only\+Substance\+Units\char`\"{} discussed below.

In S\+B\+ML Level~3, if the \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute is not set on a given \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object instance, then the unit of {\itshape amount} for that species is inherited from the \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute on the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object instance. If that attribute on \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} is not set either, then the unit associated with the species\textquotesingle{} quantity is undefined.

In S\+B\+ML Level~2, if the \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute is not set on a given \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object instance, then the unit of {\itshape amount} for that species is taken from the predefined S\+B\+ML unit identifier {\ttfamily \char`\"{}substance\char`\"{}}. The value assigned to \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} must be chosen from one of the following possibilities\+: one of the base unit identifiers defined in S\+B\+ML, the built-\/in unit identifier {\ttfamily \char`\"{}substance\char`\"{}}, or the identifier of a new unit defined in the list of unit definitions in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object. The chosen units for \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} must be be {\ttfamily \char`\"{}dimensionless\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}mole\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}item\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}kilogram\char`\"{}}, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}gram\char`\"{}}, or units derived from these.

As noted at the beginning of this section, simply setting \char`\"{}initial\+Amount\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}initial\+Concentration\char`\"{} alone does {\itshape not} determine whether a species identifier represents an amount or a concentration when it appears elsewhere in an S\+B\+ML model. The role of the attribute \char`\"{}has\+Only\+Substance\+Units\char`\"{} is to indicate whether the units of the species, when the species identifier appears in mathematical formulas, are intended to be concentration or amount. The attribute takes on a boolean value. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, the attribute has no default value and must always be set in a model; in S\+B\+ML Level~2, it has a default value of {\ttfamily false}.

The {\itshape units of the species} are used in the following ways\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When the species\textquotesingle{} identifier appears in a Math\+ML formula, it represents the species\textquotesingle{} quantity, and the unit of measurement associated with the quantity is as described above.


\item The \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} elements of \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} and \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} objects referring to this species should all have the same units as the unit of measurement associated with the species quantity.


\item In a \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} object that defines the rate of change of the species\textquotesingle{} quantity, the unit associated with the rule\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} element should be equal to the unit of the species\textquotesingle{} quantity divided by the model-\/wide unit of {\itshape time}; in other words, \{{\itshape unit of species quantity}\}/\{{\itshape unit of time}\}.


\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{class_species_species-constant}{}\subsection{The \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}boundary\+Condition\char`\"{} attributes}\label{class_species_species-constant}
The \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object class has two boolean attributes named \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}boundary\+Condition\char`\"{}, used to indicate whether and how the quantity of that species can vary during a simulation. In S\+B\+ML Level~2 they are optional; in S\+B\+ML Level~3 they are mandatory. The following table shows how to interpret the combined values of these attributes.



By default, when a species is a product or reactant of one or more reactions, its quantity is determined by those reactions. In S\+B\+ML, it is possible to indicate that a given species\textquotesingle{} quantity is {\itshape not} determined by the set of reactions even when that species occurs as a product or reactant; i.\+e., the species is on the {\itshape boundary} of the reaction system, and its quantity is not determined by the reactions. The boolean attribute \char`\"{}boundary\+Condition\char`\"{} can be used to indicate this. A value of {\ttfamily false} indicates that the species {\itshape is} part of the reaction system. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the attribute has a default value of {\ttfamily false}, while in S\+B\+ML Level~3, it has no default.

The \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute indicates whether the species\textquotesingle{} quantity can be changed at all, regardless of whether by reactions, rules, or constructs other than \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}. A value of {\ttfamily false} indicates that the species\textquotesingle{} quantity can be changed. (This is also a common value because the purpose of most simulations is precisely to calculate changes in species quantities.) In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the attribute has a default value of {\ttfamily false}, while in S\+B\+ML Level~3, it has no default. Note that the initial quantity of a species can be set by an \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} irrespective of the value of the \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute.

In practice, a \char`\"{}boundary\+Condition\char`\"{} value of {\ttfamily true} means a differential equation derived from the reaction definitions should not be generated for the species. However, the species\textquotesingle{} quantity may still be changed by \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}, and \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} constructs if its \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute is {\ttfamily false}. Conversely, if the species\textquotesingle{} \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute is {\ttfamily true}, then its value cannot be changed by anything except \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}.

A species having \char`\"{}boundary\+Condition\char`\"{}={\ttfamily false} and \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{}={\ttfamily false} can appear as a product and/or reactant of one or more reactions in the model. If the species is a reactant or product of a reaction, it must {\itshape not} also appear as the target of any \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} object in the model. If instead the species has \char`\"{}boundary\+Condition\char`\"{}={\ttfamily false} and \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{}={\ttfamily true}, then it cannot appear as a reactant or product, or as the target of any \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} object in the model.

Finally, it is worth clarifying that while the constant and boundary\+Condition attributes restrict whether and how the species amount changes, the same is not true of a species\textquotesingle{} concentration. In S\+B\+ML, the concentration of a species is a quantity that depends on the size of the compartment in which it is located. A compartment\textquotesingle{}s size may change, and therefore, so can the concentration of a species even if the amount of the species remains unchanged. A species\textquotesingle{} concentration may therefore vary even if the \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object\textquotesingle{}s constant attribute is set to {\ttfamily true} in a model.\hypertarget{class_species_species-l2-convfactor}{}\subsection{The conversion\+Factor attribute in S\+B\+M\+L Level 3}\label{class_species_species-l2-convfactor}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3, \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} has an additional optional attribute, \char`\"{}conversion\+Factor\char`\"{}, that defines a conversion factor that applies to a particular species. The value must be the identifier of a \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} object instance defined in the model. That \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} object must be a constant, meaning its \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute must be set to {\ttfamily true}. If a given \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object definition defines a value for its \char`\"{}conversion\+Factor\char`\"{} attribute, it takes precedence over any factor defined by the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}conversion\+Factor\char`\"{} attribute.

The unit of measurement associated with a species\textquotesingle{} quantity can be different from the unit of extent of reactions in the model. S\+B\+ML Level~3 avoids implicit unit conversions by providing an explicit way to indicate any unit conversion that might be required. The use of a conversion factor in computing the effects of reactions on a species\textquotesingle{} quantity is explained in detail in the S\+B\+ML Level~3 specification document. Because the value of the \char`\"{}conversion\+Factor\char`\"{} attribute is the identifier of a \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter} object, and because parameters can have units attached to them, the transformation from reaction extent units to species units can be completely specified using this approach.

Note that the unit conversion factor is {\bfseries only applied when calculating the effect of a reaction on a species}. It is not used in any rules or other S\+B\+ML constructs that affect the species, and it is also not used when the value of the species is referenced in a mathematical expression.\hypertarget{class_species_species-l2-type}{}\subsection{The species\+Type attribute in S\+B\+M\+L Level 2 Versions 2–4}\label{class_species_species-l2-type}
In S\+B\+ML Level~2 Versions~2--4, each species in a model may optionally be designated as belonging to a particular species type. The optional attribute \char`\"{}species\+Type\char`\"{} is used to identify the species type of the chemical entities that make up the pool represented by the \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} objects. The attribute\textquotesingle{}s value must be the identifier of an existing \hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type} object in the model. If the \char`\"{}species\+Type\char`\"{} attribute is not present on a particular species definition, it means the pool contains chemical entities of a type unique to that pool; in effect, a virtual species type is assumed for that species, and no other species can belong to that species type. The value of \char`\"{}species\+Type\char`\"{} attributes on species have no effect on the numerical interpretation of a model; simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore \char`\"{}species\+Type\char`\"{} attributes.

There can be only one species of a given species type in any given compartment of a model. More specifically, for all \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} objects having a value for the \char`\"{}species\+Type\char`\"{} attribute, the pair \begin{center} (\char`\"{}species\+Type\char`\"{} attribute value, \char`\"{}compartment\char`\"{} attribute value) \end{center} 

must be unique across the set of all \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object in a model.\hypertarget{class_species_species-other}{}\subsection{The spatial\+Size\+Units attribute in S\+B\+M\+L Level 2 Versions 1–2}\label{class_species_species-other}
In versions of S\+B\+ML Level~2 before Version~3, the class \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} included an attribute called \char`\"{}spatial\+Size\+Units\char`\"{}, which allowed explicitly setting the units of size for initial concentration. Lib\+S\+B\+ML retains this attribute for compatibility with older definitions of Level~2, but its use is strongly discouraged because many software tools do no properly interpret this unit declaration and it is incompatible with all S\+B\+ML specifications after Level~2 Version~3.\hypertarget{class_species_species-math}{}\subsection{Additional considerations for interpreting the numerical value of a species}\label{class_species_species-math}
\hyperlink{class_species}{Species} are unique in S\+B\+ML in that they have a kind of duality\+: a species identifier may stand for either substance amount (meaning, a count of the number of individual entities) or a concentration or density (meaning, amount divided by a compartment size). The previous sections explain the meaning of a species identifier when it is referenced in a mathematical formula or in rules or other S\+B\+ML constructs; however, it remains to specify what happens to a species when the compartment in which it is located changes in size.

When a species definition has a \char`\"{}has\+Only\+Substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute value of {\ttfamily false} and the size of the compartment in which the species is located changes, the default in S\+B\+ML is to assume that it is the concentration that must be updated to account for the size change. This follows from the principle that, all other things held constant, if a compartment simply changes in size, the size change does not in itself cause an increase or decrease in the number of entities of any species in that compartment. In a sense, the default is that the {\itshape amount} of a species is preserved across compartment size changes. Upon such size changes, the value of the concentration or density must be recalculated from the simple relationship {\itshape concentration = amount / size} if the value of the concentration is needed (for example, if the species identifier appears in a mathematical formula or is otherwise referenced in an S\+B\+ML construct). There is one exception\+: if the species\textquotesingle{} quantity is determined by an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule}, \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}, or an \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} and the species has a \char`\"{}has\+Only\+Substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute value of {\ttfamily false}, it means that the {\itshape concentration} is assigned by the rule or event; in that case, the {\itshape amount} must be calculated when the compartment size changes. (Events also require additional care in this situation, because an event with multiple assignments could conceivably reassign both a species quantity and a compartment size simultaneously. Please refer to the S\+B\+ML specifications for the details.)

Note that the above only matters if a species has a \char`\"{}has\+Only\+Substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute value of {\ttfamily false}, meaning that the species identifier refers to a concentration wherever the identifier appears in a mathematical formula. If instead the attribute\textquotesingle{}s value is {\ttfamily true}, then the identifier of the species {\itshape always} stands for an amount wherever it appears in a mathematical formula or is referenced by an S\+B\+ML construct. In that case, there is never a question about whether an assignment or event is meant to affect the amount or concentration\+: it is always the amount.

A particularly confusing situation can occur when the species has \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} attribute value of {\ttfamily true} in combination with a \char`\"{}has\+Only\+Substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute value of {\ttfamily false}. Suppose this species is given a value for \char`\"{}initial\+Concentration\char`\"{}. Does a \char`\"{}constant\char`\"{} value of {\ttfamily true} mean that the concentration is held constant if the compartment size changes? No; it is still the amount that is kept constant across a compartment size change. The fact that the species was initialized using a concentration value is irrelevant. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a25d4ca014bebcea9306ce90ff03c2d62}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a25d4ca014bebcea9306ce90ff03c2d62}}

\{core\} A {\itshape species type} in S\+B\+ML Level 2.

The term {\itshape species} {\itshape type} refers to reacting entities independent of location. These include simple ions (e.\+g., protons, calcium), simple molecules (e.\+g., glucose, A\+TP), large molecules (e.\+g., R\+NA, polysaccharides, and proteins), and others.

S\+B\+ML Level~2 Versions~2--4 provide an explicit \hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type} class of object to enable \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} objects of the same type to be related together. \hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type} is a conceptual construct; the existence of \hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type} objects in a model has no effect on the model\textquotesingle{}s numerical interpretation. Except for the requirement for uniqueness of species/species type combinations located in compartments, simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore \hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type} definitions and references to them in a model.

There is no mechanism in S\+B\+ML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of species types. One \hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type} object cannot be the subtype of another \hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type} object; S\+B\+ML provides no means of defining such relationships.

As with other major structures in S\+B\+ML, \hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type} has a mandatory attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, used to give the species type an identifier. The identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax permitted in S\+B\+ML. \hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type} also has an optional \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute, of type {\ttfamily string}. The \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specification (e.\+g., Section 3.\+3 in the Level~2 Version~4 specification).

\hyperlink{class_species_type}{Species\+Type} was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level 2 Version 2. It is not available in S\+B\+ML Level~1 nor in Level~3.

\{core\} Stochiometry expressions in S\+B\+ML Level 2 reactions.\hypertarget{class_stoichiometry_math_l2-stoichiometries}{}\subsection{Stoichiometries in S\+B\+M\+L Level 2}\label{class_stoichiometry_math_l2-stoichiometries}
In S\+B\+ML Level 2, product and reactant stoichiometries can be specified using {\itshape either} the \char`\"{}stoichiometry\char`\"{} attribute or a \char`\"{}stoichiometry\+Math\char`\"{} element in a \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} object. The \char`\"{}stoichiometry\char`\"{} attribute is of type {\ttfamily double} and should contain values greater than zero (0). The \char`\"{}stoichiometry\+Math\char`\"{} element is implemented as an element containing a Math\+ML expression. These two are mutually exclusive; only one of \char`\"{}stoichiometry\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}stoichiometry\+Math\char`\"{} should be defined in a given \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} instance. When neither the attribute nor the element is present, the value of \char`\"{}stoichiometry\char`\"{} in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} instance defaults to {\ttfamily 1}.

For maximum interoperability, \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}stoichiometry\char`\"{} attribute should be used in preference to \char`\"{}stoichiometry\+Math\char`\"{} when a species\textquotesingle{} stoichiometry is a simple scalar number (integer or decimal). When the stoichiometry is a rational number, or when it is a more complicated formula, \char`\"{}stoichiometry\+Math\char`\"{} must be used. The Math\+ML expression in \char`\"{}stoichiometry\+Math\char`\"{} may also refer to identifiers of entities in a model (except reaction identifiers). However, the only species identifiers that can be used in \char`\"{}stoichiometry\+Math\char`\"{} are those referenced in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}\textquotesingle{}s list of reactants, products and modifiers.

The \char`\"{}stoichiometry\char`\"{} attribute and the \char`\"{}stoichiometry\+Math\char`\"{} element, when either is used, is each interpreted as a factor applied to the reaction rate to produce the rate of change of the species identified by the \char`\"{}species\char`\"{} attribute in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference}. This is the normal interpretation of a stoichiometry, but in S\+B\+ML, one additional consideration has to be taken into account. The reaction rate, which is the result of the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law}\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} element, is always in the model\textquotesingle{}s {\itshape substance} per {\itshape time} units. However, the rate of change of the species will involve the species\textquotesingle{} {\itshape substance} units (i.\+e., the units identified by the \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} attribute), and these units may be different from the model\textquotesingle{}s default {\itshape substance} units. If the units {\itshape are} different, the stoichiometry must incorporate a conversion factor for converting the model\textquotesingle{}s {\itshape substance} units to the species\textquotesingle{} {\itshape substance} units. The conversion factor is assumed to be included in the scalar value of the \char`\"{}stoichiometry\char`\"{} attribute if \char`\"{}stoichiometry\char`\"{} is used. If instead \char`\"{}stoichiometry\+Math\char`\"{} is used, then the product of the model\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}substance\char`\"{} units times the \char`\"{}stoichiometry\+Math\char`\"{} units must match the {\itshape substance} units of the species. Note that in either case, if the species\textquotesingle{} units and the model\textquotesingle{}s default {\itshape substance} units are the same, the stoichiometry ends up being a dimensionless number and equivalent to the standard chemical stoichiometry found in textbooks. Examples and more explanations of this are given in the S\+B\+ML specification.

The following is a simple example of a species reference for species {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+X0\char`\"{}}, with stoichiometry {\ttfamily 2}, in a list of reactants within a reaction having the identifier {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+J1\char`\"{}}\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<model>

Additional discussions of stoichiometries and implications for species and reactions are included in the documentation of \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} class.\hypertarget{class_stoichiometry_math_l3-stoichiometries}{}\subsection{Stoichiometries in S\+B\+M\+L Level 3}\label{class_stoichiometry_math_l3-stoichiometries}
The \hyperlink{class_stoichiometry_math}{Stoichiometry\+Math} construct is not defined in S\+B\+ML Level~3. Instead, Level~3 defines the identifier of \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} objects as a stand-\/in for the stoichiometry of the reactant or product being referenced, and allows that identifier to be used elsewhere in S\+B\+ML models, including (for example) \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} objects. This makes it possible to achieve the same effect as \hyperlink{class_stoichiometry_math}{Stoichiometry\+Math}, but with other S\+B\+ML objects. For instance, to produce a stoichiometry value that is a rational number, a model can use \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment} to assign the identifier of a \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} object to a Math\+ML expression evaluating to a rational number. This is analogous to the same way that, in Level~2, the model would use \hyperlink{class_stoichiometry_math}{Stoichiometry\+Math} with a Math\+ML expression evaluating to a rational number.

In S\+B\+ML Level 2, the stoichiometry of a reactant or product is a combination of both a {\itshape biochemical stoichiometry} (meaning, the standard stoichiometry of a species in a reaction) and any necessary unit conversion factors. The introduction of an explicit attribute on the \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} object for a conversion factor allows Level~3 to avoid having to overload the meaning of stoichiometry. In Level~3, the stoichiometry given by a \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} object in a reaction is a \char`\"{}proper\char`\"{} biochemical stoichiometry, meaning a dimensionless number free of unit conversions.

\{core\} The trigger expression for an S\+B\+ML {\itshape event}.

An \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object defines when the event can occur, the variables that are affected by the event, and how the variables are affected. The \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} construct in S\+B\+ML is used to define a mathematical expression that determines when an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} is {\itshape triggered}.

A \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} object in S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3 contains one subelement named \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} containing a Math\+ML expression. The expression is evaluated as a value of type {\ttfamily boolean}. The exact moment at which the expression evaluates to {\ttfamily true} is the time point when the \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} is {\itshape triggered}. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} has additional attributes that must be assigned values; they are discussed in a separate section below.

In S\+B\+ML Level~2 and S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1, the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} subelement is required, and it must evaluate to a {\ttfamily boolean} expression. In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, those restrictions are relaxed\+: the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} element is optional, and numeric values are allowed in Boolean contexts (a \textquotesingle{}0\textquotesingle{} is interpreted as {\ttfamily false}, and all other values are interpreted as {\ttfamily true}). If a \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} with no \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} is present in an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}, that \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} will never {\itshape trigger}, unless that missing information is included in an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package.

An event only {\itshape triggers} when its \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} expression makes the transition in value from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true}. The event will also trigger at any subsequent time points when the trigger makes this transition; in other words, an event can be triggered multiple times during a simulation if its trigger condition makes the transition from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true} more than once. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, the behavior at the very start of simulation (i.\+e., at {\itshape t = 0}, where {\itshape t} stands for time) is determined in part by the boolean flag \char`\"{}initial\+Value\char`\"{}. This and other additional features introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~3 are discussed further below.\hypertarget{class_trigger_trigger-version-diffs}{}\subsection{Version differences}\label{class_trigger_trigger-version-diffs}
S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1 introduces two required attributes on the \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} object\+: \char`\"{}persistent\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}initial\+Value\char`\"{}. The rest of this introduction describes these two attributes.\hypertarget{class_trigger_trigger-persistent}{}\subsubsection{The \char`\"{}persistent\char`\"{} attribute on Trigger}\label{class_trigger_trigger-persistent}
In the interval between when an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object {\itshape triggers} (i.\+e., its \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} object expression transitions in value from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true}) and when its assignments are to be {\itshape executed}, conditions in the model may change such that the trigger expression transitions back from {\ttfamily true} to {\ttfamily false}. Should the event\textquotesingle{}s assignments still be made if this happens? Answering this question is the purpose of the \char`\"{}persistent\char`\"{} attribute on \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger}.

If the boolean attribute \char`\"{}persistent\char`\"{} has a value of {\ttfamily true}, then once the event is triggered, all of its assignments are always performed when the time of execution is reached. The name {\itshape persistent} is meant to evoke the idea that the trigger expression does not have to be re-\/checked after it triggers if \char`\"{}persistent\char`\"{}={\ttfamily true}. Conversely, if the attribute value is {\ttfamily false}, then the trigger expression is not assumed to persist\+: if the expression transitions in value back to {\ttfamily false} at any time between when the event triggered and when it is to be executed, the event is no longer considered to have triggered and its assignments are not executed. (If the trigger expression transitions once more to {\ttfamily true} after that point, then the event is triggered, but this then constitutes a whole new event trigger-\/and-\/execute sequence.)

The \char`\"{}persistent\char`\"{} attribute can be especially useful when \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} objects contain \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} objects, but it is relevant even in a model without delays if the model contains two or more events. As explained in the introduction to this section, the operation of all events in S\+B\+ML (delayed or not) is conceptually divided into two phases, {\itshape triggering} and {\itshape execution}; however, unless events have priorities associated with them, S\+B\+ML does not mandate a particular ordering of event execution in the case of simultaneous events. Models with multiple events can lead to situations where the execution of one event affects another event\textquotesingle{}s trigger expression value. If that other event has \char`\"{}persistent\char`\"{}={\ttfamily false}, and its trigger expression evaluates to {\ttfamily false} before it is to be executed, the event must not be executed after all.\hypertarget{class_trigger_trigger-initialvalue}{}\subsubsection{The \char`\"{}initial\+Value\char`\"{} attribute on Trigger}\label{class_trigger_trigger-initialvalue}
As mentioned above, an event {\itshape triggers} when the mathematical expression in its \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} object transitions in value from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true}. An unanswered question concerns what happens at the start of a simulation\+: can event triggers make this transition at {\itshape t = 0}, where {\itshape t} stands for time?

In order to determine whether an event may trigger at {\itshape t = 0}, it is necessary to know what value the \hyperlink{class_trigger}{Trigger} object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expression had immediately prior to {\itshape t = 0}. This starting value of the trigger expression is determined by the value of the boolean attribute \char`\"{}initial\+Value\char`\"{}. A value of {\ttfamily true} means the trigger expression is taken to have the value {\ttfamily true} immediately prior to {\itshape t = 0}. In that case, the trigger cannot transition in value from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true} at the moment simulation begins (because it has the value {\ttfamily true} both before and after {\itshape t = 0}), and can only make the transition from {\ttfamily false} to {\ttfamily true} sometime {\itshape after} {\itshape t = 0}. (To do that, it would also first have to transition to {\ttfamily false} before it could make the transition from {\ttfamily false} back to {\ttfamily true}.) Conversely, if \char`\"{}initial\+Value\char`\"{}={\ttfamily false}, then the trigger expression is assumed to start with the value {\ttfamily false}, and therefore may trigger at {\itshape t = 0} if the expression evaluates to {\ttfamily true} at that moment.

\{core\} A single unit referenced in an S\+B\+ML {\itshape unit definition}.

The S\+B\+ML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects, \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} and \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit}. The approach to defining units in S\+B\+ML is compositional; for example, {\itshape meter second\textsuperscript{ --2}} is constructed by combining a \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} object representing {\itshape meter} with another \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} object representing {\itshape second\textsuperscript{ --2}}. The combination is wrapped inside a \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition}, which provides for assigning an identifier and optional name to the combination. The identifier can then be referenced from elsewhere in a model. Thus, the \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} class is the container, and \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} instances are placed inside \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} instances.

A \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} has four attributes named \char`\"{}kind\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}exponent\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}scale\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}multiplier\char`\"{}. It represents a (possibly transformed) reference to a base unit. The attribute \char`\"{}kind\char`\"{} on \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} indicates the chosen base unit. Its value must be one of the text strings listed below; this list corresponds to S\+B\+ML Level~3\+:

A few small differences exist between the Level~3 list of base units and the list defined in other Level/\+Version combinations of S\+B\+ML. Specifically, Levels of S\+B\+ML before Level~3 do not define {\ttfamily avogadro}; conversely, Level~2 Version~1 defines {\ttfamily Celsius}, and Level~1 defines {\ttfamily celsius}, {\ttfamily meter}, and {\ttfamily liter}, none of which are available in Level~3. In lib\+S\+B\+ML, each of the predefined base unit names is represented by an enumeration value whose name begins with the characters {\ttfamily U\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+K\+I\+N\+D\+\_\+}, discussed in a separate section below.

The attribute named \char`\"{}exponent\char`\"{} on \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} represents an exponent on the unit. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the attribute is optional and has a default value of {\ttfamily 1} (one); in S\+B\+ML Level~3, the attribute is mandatory and there is no default value. A \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} also has an attribute called \char`\"{}scale\char`\"{}; its value must be an integer exponent for a power-\/of-\/ten multiplier used to set the scale of the unit. For example, a unit having a \char`\"{}kind\char`\"{} value of {\ttfamily gram} and a \char`\"{}scale\char`\"{} value of {\ttfamily -\/3} signifies 10\textsuperscript{~--3} $\times$ gram, or milligrams. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the attribute is optional and has a default value of {\ttfamily 0} (zero), because 10\textsuperscript{ 0} = 1; in S\+B\+ML Level~3, the attribute is mandatory and has no default value. Lastly, the attribute named \char`\"{}multiplier\char`\"{} can be used to multiply the unit by a real-\/numbered factor; this enables the definition of units that are not power-\/of-\/ten multiples of SI units. For instance, a multiplier of 0.\+3048 could be used to define {\ttfamily foot} as a measure of length in terms of a {\ttfamily metre}. The \char`\"{}multiplier\char`\"{} attribute is optional in S\+B\+ML Level~2, where it has a default value of {\ttfamily 1} (one); in S\+B\+ML Level~3, the attribute is mandatory and has not default value.

\paragraph*{\label{_UnitKind_t}%
Unit identification codes}

As discussed above, S\+B\+ML defines a set of base units which serves as the starting point for new unit definitions. This set of base units consists of the SI units and a small number of additional convenience units.

As a consequence of the fact that lib\+S\+B\+ML supports models in all Levels and Versions of S\+B\+ML, lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s set of {\ttfamily U\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+K\+I\+N\+D\+\_\+} values is a union of all the possible base unit names defined in the different S\+B\+ML specifications. However, not every base unit is allowed in every Level+\+Version combination of S\+B\+ML. Note in particular the following exceptions\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The alternate spelling {\ttfamily \char`\"{}meter\char`\"{}} is included in addition to the official SI spelling {\ttfamily \char`\"{}metre\char`\"{}}. This spelling is only permitted in S\+B\+ML Level~1 models.


\item The alternate spelling {\ttfamily \char`\"{}liter\char`\"{}} is included in addition to the official SI spelling {\ttfamily \char`\"{}litre\char`\"{}}. This spelling is only permitted in S\+B\+ML Level~1 models.


\item The unit {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Celsius\char`\"{}} is included because of its presence in specifications of S\+B\+ML prior to S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~3.


\item The unit {\ttfamily avogadro} was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~3, and is only permitted for use in S\+B\+ML Level~3 models.

\{core\} A definition of a unit used in an S\+B\+ML model.

Units of measurement may be supplied in a number of contexts in an S\+B\+ML model. The S\+B\+ML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects, \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} and \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit}. The approach to defining units in S\+B\+ML is compositional; for example, {\itshape meter second\textsuperscript{ --2}} is constructed by combining a \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} object representing {\itshape meter} with another \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} object representing {\itshape second\textsuperscript{ --2}}. The combination is wrapped inside a \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition}, which provides for assigning an identifier and optional name to the combination. The identifier can then be referenced from elsewhere in a model. Thus, the \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} class is the container, and \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} instances are placed inside \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} instances.

Two points are worth discussing in the context of S\+B\+ML units. First, unit declarations in S\+B\+ML models are {\itshape optional}. The consequence of this is that a model must be numerically self-\/consistent independently of unit declarations, for the benefit of software tools that cannot interpret or manipulate units. \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} declarations in S\+B\+ML are thus more akin to a type of annotation; they can indicate intentions, and can be used by model readers for checking the consistency of the model, labeling simulation output, etc., but any transformations of values implied by different units must be incorporated {\itshape explicitly} into a model.

Second, the vast majority of situations that require new S\+B\+ML unit definitions involve simple multiplicative combinations of base units and factors. An example is {\itshape moles per litre per second}. What distinguishes these sorts of unit definitions from more complex ones is that they may be expressed without the use of an additive offset from a zero point. The use of offsets complicates all unit definition systems, yet in the domain of S\+B\+ML, the real-\/life cases requiring offsets are few (and in fact, to the best of our knowledge, only involve temperature). Consequently, the S\+B\+ML unit system has been consciously designed to simplify implementation of unit support for the most common cases in systems biology. The cost of this simplification is to require units with offsets to be handled explicitly by the modeler.\hypertarget{class_unit_definition_unitdef-summary}{}\subsection{Summary of the Unit\+Definition construct}\label{class_unit_definition_unitdef-summary}
\hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} has two attributes and one subelement. The two attributes are \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{}, and the subelement is \hyperlink{class_list_of_units}{List\+Of\+Units}.

The required attribute \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and optional attribute \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} are both strings. The \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attribute is used to give the defined unit a unique identifier by which other parts of an S\+B\+ML model definition can refer to it. The \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute is intended to be used for giving the unit definition an optional human-\/readable name. Please see the \href{#unitdef-id}{\tt next section} for information about the values permitted for \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}.

A \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} may contain exactly one \hyperlink{class_list_of_units}{List\+Of\+Units}, and this list may contain one or more \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} definitions; see the definitions of these other object classes for more information about them. In S\+B\+ML Level~2 and S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~1, if the \hyperlink{class_list_of_units}{List\+Of\+Units} was present, it must have one or more \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} definitions. In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, this restriction was relaxed, and a \hyperlink{class_list_of_units}{List\+Of\+Units} was allowed to be empty. In either case, if a \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} had no child \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} elements, the unit was considered to be undefined.

The following example illustrates a complete unit definition (when written in X\+ML) when all the pieces are combined together. This defines \char`\"{}mmls\char`\"{} to be millimoles per litre per second. \begin{DoxyVerb}<listOfUnitDefinitions>
    <unitDefinition id="mmls">

\hypertarget{class_unit_definition_unitdef-id}{}\subsection{Special considerations for Unit object identifiers}\label{class_unit_definition_unitdef-id}
The attribute \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} in \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} cannot be given simply any value, and the precise details of the values permitted differ slightly between Levels of S\+B\+ML\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} of a \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} must {\itshape not} contain a value from the list of S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s predefined base unit names (i.\+e., the strings {\ttfamily gram}, {\ttfamily litre}, etc.). In S\+B\+ML Level~3, this list consists of the following\+:

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}

\end{longtabu}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
This list of predefined base units is nearly identical in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~4, the exception being that Level~2 does not define {\ttfamily avogadro}. S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~1 (and {\itshape only} this Level+\+Version combination) provides an additional predefined unit name, {\ttfamily Celsius}, not available in Level~3. Finally, S\+B\+ML Level~1 Versions~2--3 provide two more additional predefined unit names, {\ttfamily meter} and {\ttfamily liter}. This is explained in somewhat greater detail in the description of the \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} class.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In S\+B\+ML Level~2 (all Versions), there is an additional set of reserved identifiers\+: {\ttfamily substance}, {\ttfamily volume}, {\ttfamily area}, {\ttfamily length}, and {\ttfamily time}. Using one of these values for the attribute \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} of a \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} has the effect of redefining the model-\/wide default units for the corresponding quantities. The list of special unit names in S\+B\+ML Level~2 is given in the table below\+: 
\end{DoxyItemize}



Also, S\+B\+ML Level~2 imposes two limitations on redefining the predefined unit {\ttfamily substance}, {\ttfamily volume}, {\ttfamily area}, {\ttfamily length}, and {\ttfamily time\+:} (1) The \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} of a predefined S\+B\+ML unit can only contain a single \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} object within it. (2) The value of the \char`\"{}kind\char`\"{} attribute in a \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} instance must be drawn from one of the values in the second column of the table above.

The special unit names {\ttfamily substance}, {\ttfamily volume}, {\ttfamily area}, {\ttfamily length}, and {\ttfamily time} are not defined by S\+B\+ML Level~3, which uses a different approach to setting model-\/wide inherited units.

Consequently, the S\+B\+ML unit system has been consciously designed in a way that attempts to simplify implementation of unit support for the most common cases in systems biology.

As of S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~2, \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} no longer has the attribute called \char`\"{}offset\char`\"{} introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~1. It turned out that the general case involving units with offsets was incorrectly defined, and few (if any) developers even attempted to support offset-\/based units in their software. In the development of Level~2 Version~2, a consensus among S\+B\+ML developers emerged that a fully generalized unit scheme is {\itshape so} confusing and complicated that it actually {\itshape impedes} interoperability. S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~2, Version~3 and Version~4 acknowledge this reality by reducing and simplifying the unit system, specifically by removing the \char`\"{}offset\char`\"{} attribute on \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} and {\ttfamily Celsius} as a pre-\/defined unit.

The following guidelines suggest methods for handling units that do require the use of zero offsets for their definitions\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Handling Celsius}. A model in which certain quantities are temperatures measured in degrees Celsius can be converted straightforwardly to a model in which those temperatures are in kelvin. A software tool could do this by performing a straightforward substitution using the following relationship\+: {\itshape T\textsubscript{ kelvin} = T\textsubscript{Celsius} + 273.\+15}. In every mathematical formula of the model where a quantity (call it {\itshape x}) in degrees Celsius appears, replace {\itshape x} with {\itshape x\textsubscript{k}+ 273.\+15}, where {\itshape x\textsubscript{k}} is now in kelvin. An alternative approach would be to use a \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} object to define a function encapsulating this relationship above and then using that in the rest of the model as needed. Since Celsius is a commonly-\/used unit, software tools could help users by providing users with the ability to express temperatures in Celsius in the tools\textquotesingle{} interfaces, and making substitutions automatically when writing out the S\+B\+ML.


\item {\itshape Other units requiring offsets}. One approach to handling other kinds of units is to use a \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} to define a function encapsulating the necessary mathematical relationship, then substituting a call to this function wherever the original quantity appeared in the model. For example, here is a possible definition for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius degrees\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<functionDefinition id="Fahrenheit_to_kelvin">
    <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">
        <lambda>
            <bvar><ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci></bvar>
            <apply>
                <divide/>
                <apply>
                    <plus/>
                    <ci> temp_in_fahrenheit </ci>
                    <cn> 459.67 </cn>
                </apply>
                <cn> 1.8 </cn>
            </apply>
        </lambda>
    </math>
</functionDefinition>
\end{DoxyVerb}



\item An alternative approach not requiring the use of function definitions is to use an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} for each variable in Fahrenheit units. The \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} could compute the conversion from Fahrenheit to (say) kelvin, assign its value to a variable (in Kelvin units), and then that variable could be used elsewhere in the model.


\item Still another approach is to rewrite the mathematical formulas of a model to directly incorporate the conversion formula wherever the original quantity appeared.

\{core\} A list of attributes on an X\+ML element.



In lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s X\+ML interface layer, attributes on an element are stored as a list of values kept in an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} object. \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} has methods for adding and removing individual attributes as well as performing other actions on the list of attributes. Classes in lib\+S\+B\+ML that represent nodes in an X\+ML document (i.\+e., \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} and its parent class, \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token}) use \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} objects to manage attributes on X\+ML elements.

Attributes on an X\+ML element can be written in one of two forms\+: \begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily name=\char`\"{}value\char`\"{}} \item {\ttfamily prefix\+:name=\char`\"{}value\char`\"{}}\end{DoxyItemize}
An attribute in X\+ML must always have a value, and the value must always be a quoted string; i.\+e., it is always {\ttfamily name=\char`\"{}value\char`\"{}} and not {\ttfamily name=value}. An empty value is represented simply as an empty string; i.\+e., {\ttfamily name=\char`\"{}\char`\"{}}.

In cases when a {\ttfamily prefix} is provided with an attribute name, general X\+ML validity rules require that the prefix is an X\+ML namespace prefix that has been declared somewhere else (possibly as an another attribute on the same element). However, the \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} class does {\itshape not} test for the proper existence or declaration of X\+ML namespaces---callers must arrange to do this themselves in some other way. This class only provides facilities for tracking and manipulating attributes and their prefix/\+U\+R\+I/name/value components.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Note that although \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} provides operations that can manipulate attributes based on a numerical index, X\+ML attributes are in fact unordered when they appear in files and data streams. The \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} class provides some list-\/like facilities, but it is only for the convenience of callers. (For example, it permits callers to loop across all attributes more easily.) Users should keep in mind that the order in which attributes are stored in \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} objects has no real impact on the order in which the attributes are read or written from an X\+ML file or data stream.

\{core\} X\+M\+L-\/level errors, warnings and other diagnostics.



Lib\+S\+B\+ML can be configured to use any of a number of X\+ML parsers; at the time of this writing, lib\+S\+B\+ML supports Xerces versions 2.\+4 through 3.\+1, Expat version 1.\+95.\+x and higher, and libxml2 version 2.\+6.\+16 and higher. These parsers each report different status codes for the various exceptions that can occur during X\+ML processing. The \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} object class abstracts away from the particular diagnostics reported by the different parsers and presents a single uniform interface and set of status codes, along with operations for manipulating the error objects.

When the lib\+S\+B\+ML X\+ML parser layer encounters an error in the X\+ML content being processed, or when there is something else wrong (such as an out-\/of-\/memory condition), the problems are reported as \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} objects. Each \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} object instance has an identification number that identifies the nature of the problem. This error identifier is one of the constants listed in the next section below. Applications can use the error identifiers as a means of recognizing the error encountered and changing their behavior if desired.

Integer error codes are useful for software, but not so much for telling humans what happened. For this reason, \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} also provides two text messages describing the nature of the error. These messages are accessible by means of the methods X\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Short\+Message() and X\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Message(). The method X\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Short\+Message() returns a very brief synopsis of the warning or error condition, whereas X\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Message() returns a longer explanation. These text strings are suitable for displaying to human users.

Each \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} object also contains a category code; its value may be retrieved using the method X\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Category(). Category values are drawn from a set of constants whose names begin with the characters {\ttfamily L\+I\+B\+S\+B\+M\+L\+\_\+\+C\+A\+T\+\_\+}, described below.~Categories are used by lib\+S\+B\+ML to provide more information to calling programs about the nature of a given error.

In addition to category codes, each \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} object also has a severity code; its value may be retrieved using the method X\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Severity(). Severity code values are drawn from a set of constants whose names begin with the characters {\ttfamily L\+I\+B\+S\+B\+M\+L\+\_\+\+S\+E\+V\+\_\+}, described below. Severity levels range from informational (\{L\+I\+B\+S\+B\+M\+L\+\_\+\+S\+E\+V\+\_\+\+I\+N\+FO, X\+M\+L\+Error\+Severity\+\_\+t\}) to fatal errors (\{L\+I\+B\+S\+B\+M\+L\+\_\+\+S\+E\+V\+\_\+\+F\+A\+T\+AL, X\+M\+L\+Error\+Severity\+\_\+t\}).

Finally, \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} objects record the line and column near where the problem occurred in the X\+ML content. The values can be retrieved using the methods X\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Line() and X\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Column(). We say \char`\"{}near
where the problem occurred\char`\"{}, because many factors affect how accurate the line/column information ultimately is. For example, sometimes, the underlying X\+ML parsers can only report such information for the parent X\+ML element where an error occurs, and not for the specific point where the problem occurs. In other situations, some parsers report invalid line and/or column numbers altogether. If this occurs, lib\+S\+B\+ML sets the line and/or column number in the \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} object to either {\ttfamily 0} or the value of the maximum unsigned long integer representable on the platform where lib\+S\+B\+ML is running. The probability that a true line or column number in an S\+B\+ML model would equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application encounters these values in an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} object, it can assume no valid line/column number could be provided by lib\+S\+B\+ML in that situation.

\{core\} Log of diagnostics reported during X\+ML processing.



The error log is a list. The X\+ML layer of lib\+S\+B\+ML maintains an error log associated with a given X\+ML document or data stream. When an operation results in an error, or when there is something wrong with the X\+ML content, the problem is reported as an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} object stored in the \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error_log}{X\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} list. Potential problems range from low-\/level issues (such as the inability to open a file) to X\+ML syntax errors (such as mismatched tags or other problems).

A typical approach for using this error log is to first use get\+Num\+Errors() to inquire how many \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} object instances it contains, and then to iterate over the list of objects one at a time using get\+Error(unsigned int n) const. Indexing in the list begins at 0.

In normal circumstances, programs using lib\+S\+B\+ML will actually obtain an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} rather than an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error_log}{X\+M\+L\+Error\+Log}. The former is subclassed from \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error_log}{X\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} and simply wraps commands for working with \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} objects rather than the low-\/level \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error} objects. Classes such as \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} use the higher-\/level \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log}. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_ad1e0eff94536d503b61ec48cf5c5c4d1}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_ad1e0eff94536d503b61ec48cf5c5c4d1}}

\{core\} An X\+ML Namespace.



This class serves to organize functionality for tracking X\+ML namespaces in a document or data stream. The namespace declarations are stored as a list of pairs of X\+ML namespace U\+R\+Is and prefix strings. These correspond to the parts of a namespace declaration on an X\+ML element. For example, in the following X\+ML fragment, \begin{DoxyVerb}<annotation>
    <mysim:nodecolors xmlns:mysim="urn:lsid:mysim.org"
         mysim:bgcolor="green" mysim:fgcolor="white"/>
</annotation>
\end{DoxyVerb}
 there is one namespace declaration. Its U\+RI is {\ttfamily urn\+:lsid\+:mysim.\+org} and its prefix is {\ttfamily mysim}. This pair could be stored as one item in an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_namespaces}{X\+M\+L\+Namespaces} list.

\hyperlink{class_x_m_l_namespaces}{X\+M\+L\+Namespaces} provides various methods for manipulating the list of prefix-\/\+U\+RI pairs. Individual namespaces stored in a given X\+M\+L\+Namespace object instance can be retrieved based on their index using X\+M\+L\+Namespaces\+::get\+Prefix(int index), or by their characteristics such as their U\+RI or position in the list. \mbox{\Hypertarget{sbmlfwd_8h_a035e3edf4d685f0a299cec2110582910}\label{sbmlfwd_8h_a035e3edf4d685f0a299cec2110582910}}

\{core\} A node in lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s X\+ML document tree.

Lib\+S\+B\+ML implements an X\+ML abstraction layer. This layer presents a uniform X\+ML interface to calling programs regardless of which underlying X\+ML parser lib\+S\+B\+ML has actually been configured to use. The basic data object in the X\+ML abstraction is a {\itshape node}, represented by \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node}.

An \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} can contain any number of children. Each child is another \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node}, thereby forming a tree. The methods X\+M\+L\+Node\+::get\+Num\+Children() and X\+M\+L\+Node\+::get\+Child() can be used to access the tree structure starting from a given node.

Each \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} is subclassed from \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token}, and thus has the same methods available as \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token}. These methods include X\+M\+L\+Token\+::get\+Namespaces(), X\+M\+L\+Token\+::get\+Prefix(), X\+M\+L\+Token\+::get\+Name(), X\+M\+L\+Token\+::get\+U\+R\+I(), and X\+M\+L\+Token\+::get\+Attributes().\hypertarget{class_x_m_l_node_xmlnode-str2xmlnode}{}\subsection{Conversion between an X\+M\+L string and an X\+M\+L\+Node}\label{class_x_m_l_node_xmlnode-str2xmlnode}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides the following utility functions for converting an X\+ML string (e.\+g., {\ttfamily $<$annotation$>$...$<$/annotation$>$}) to/from an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} object.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item X\+M\+L\+Node\+::to\+X\+M\+L\+String() returns a string representation of the \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} object.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item X\+M\+L\+Node\+::convert\+X\+M\+L\+Node\+To\+String() (static function) returns a string representation of the given \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} object.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item X\+M\+L\+Node\+::convert\+String\+To\+X\+M\+L\+Node() (static function) returns an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} object converted from the given X\+ML string.\end{DoxyItemize}
The returned \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} object by X\+M\+L\+Node\+::convert\+String\+To\+X\+M\+L\+Node() is a dummy root (container) \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} if the given X\+ML string has two or more top-\/level elements (e.\+g., "{\ttfamily $<$p$>$...$<$/p$>$$<$p$>$...$<$/p$>$}"). In the dummy root node, each top-\/level element in the given X\+ML string is contained as a child \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node}. X\+M\+L\+Token\+::is\+E\+O\+F() can be used to identify if the returned \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} object is a dummy node or not.

\{core\} A token in an X\+ML stream.



The lib\+S\+B\+ML X\+ML parser interface can read an X\+ML file or data stream and convert the contents into tokens. The tokens represent items in the X\+ML stream, either X\+ML elements (start or end tags) or text that appears as content inside an element. The \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token} class is lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s low-\/level representation of these entities.

Each \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token} has the following information associated with it\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\itshape Qualified name}\+: every X\+ML element or X\+ML attribute has a name (e.\+g., for the element {\ttfamily $<$mytag$>$}, the name is {\ttfamily \char`\"{}mytag\char`\"{}}), but this name may be qualified with a namespace (e.\+g., it may appear as {\ttfamily $<$some\+Namespace\+:mytag$>$} in the input). An \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token} stores the name of a token, along with any namespace qualification present, through the use of an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_triple}{X\+M\+L\+Triple} object. This object stores the bare name of the element, its X\+ML namespace prefix (if any), and the X\+ML namespace with which that prefix is associated. 
\item {\itshape Namespaces\+:} An X\+ML token can have one or more X\+ML namespaces associated with it. These namespaces may be specified explicitly on the element or inherited from parent elements. In lib\+S\+B\+ML, a list of namespaces is stored in an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_namespaces}{X\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object. An \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token} possesses a field for storing an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_namespaces}{X\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object. 
\item {\itshape Attributes\+:} X\+ML elements can have attributes associated with them, and these attributes can have values assigned to them. The set of attribute-\/value pairs is stored in an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_attributes}{X\+M\+L\+Attributes} object stored in an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token} object. (Note\+: only elements can have attributes---text blocks cannot have them in X\+ML.) 
\item {\itshape Line} number\+: the line number in the input where the token appears. 
\item {\itshape Column} number\+: the column number in the input where the token appears. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

The \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token} class serves as base class for \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node}. X\+ML lends itself to a tree-\/structured representation, and in lib\+S\+B\+ML, the nodes in an X\+ML document tree are \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} objects. Most higher-\/level lib\+S\+B\+ML classes and methods that offer X\+M\+L-\/level functionality (such as the methods on \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} for interacting with annotations) work with \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_node}{X\+M\+L\+Node} objects rather than \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token} objects directly.

\{core\} A qualified X\+ML name.



A \char`\"{}triple\char`\"{} in the lib\+S\+B\+ML X\+ML layer encapsulates the notion of qualified name, meaning an element name or an attribute name with an optional namespace qualifier. Triples by themselves are not entities in an X\+ML stream---they are not, for example, elements or attributes; rather, \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_triple}{X\+M\+L\+Triple} is used in lib\+S\+B\+ML to construct these other kinds of objects.

An \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_triple}{X\+M\+L\+Triple} instance carries up to three data items\+: 
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item The name of the attribute or element; that is, the attribute name as it appears in an X\+ML document or data stream; 
\item The X\+ML namespace prefix (if any) of the attribute. For example, in the following fragment of X\+ML, the namespace prefix is the string {\ttfamily mysim} and it appears on both the element {\ttfamily someelement} and the attribute {\ttfamily attribA}. When both the element and the attribute are stored as \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_triple}{X\+M\+L\+Triple} objects, their {\itshape prefix} is {\ttfamily mysim}. \begin{DoxyVerb}<mysim:someelement mysim:attribA="value" />
\end{DoxyVerb}
 
\item The X\+ML namespace U\+RI with which the prefix is associated. In X\+ML, every namespace used must be declared and mapped to a U\+RI. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\hyperlink{class_x_m_l_triple}{X\+M\+L\+Triple} objects are the lowest-\/level data item in the X\+ML layer of lib\+S\+B\+ML. Other objects such as \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token} make use of \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_triple}{X\+M\+L\+Triple} objects.
