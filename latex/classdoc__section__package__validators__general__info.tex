\hypertarget{classdoc__section__package__validators__general__info_general-pkg-validators}{}\subsection{General information about package-\/specific validators}\label{classdoc__section__package__validators__general__info_general-pkg-validators}
The general S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency() methods that perform validation make use of the lib\+S\+B\+ML plugin mechanism to invoke the package-\/specific validators via the relevant document plugin. In the case of a validator such as Fbc\+Validator, Qual\+Validator, and others, the package-\/specific validator acts on the constructs from the relevant package rather than on core S\+B\+ML constructs. (However, this does not necessarily mean it does not take into account the whole S\+B\+ML model---the information needed by a given validator to do its work is up to the validator itself.)

Package-\/specific validators are invoked when S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency() is invoked on the overall \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object. As the main validation procedure executes, it passes control to each lib\+S\+B\+ML package plugin via the plugin\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily Package\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document_plugin}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+Plugin}} class, (where {\ttfamily Package} is the package prefix, such as {\ttfamily Qual}, or {\ttfamily Fbc}). These class implement their own consistency-\/checking functions for rules defined in the relevant S\+B\+ML Level~3 package.

The package-\/specific validators obey the same categories of consistency/error checks as are used by the overall S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency(). This means that, for example, if identifier validation is turned off, it is turned off in all S\+B\+ML Level~3 package validators too. See S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::set\+Consistency\+Checks() for more information about categories and how to control them.
