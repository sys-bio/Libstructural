\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
When a package extension is first loaded, it must register itself with the registry of extensions maintained by the cleverly-\/named \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_registry}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Registry} class. That registry is how other classes in lib\+S\+B\+ML access information about the packages recognized by a particular copy of lib\+S\+ML; a corollary is that lib\+S\+B\+ML can\textquotesingle{}t parse or even recognize S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages that have no corresponding extension registered with \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_registry}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Registry}.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_register}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Register} class is a template class for automatically registering each package extension to the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_registry}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Registry} class at startup time. The class and its use are very simple. An implementation of a package extension merely needs to use it to instantiate one object. The class used in the template invocation should be the extension derived from \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension} (e.\+g., Layout\+Extension for the Layout package). The following is an example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keyword}{static} \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_register}{SBMLExtensionRegister<LayoutExtension>} layoutExtensionRegistry
      ;
\end{DoxyCode}


The line above is typically be placed in the {\ttfamily .cpp} file associated with the definition of the S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension-\/derived class; in the case of the Layout package, this is {\ttfamily Layout\+Extension.\+cpp}.

The result of doing the above is that the {\ttfamily init()} method on {\ttfamily Layout\+Extension} will be automatically invoked when the \char`\"{}register\char`\"{} object is instantiated. This results in initialization and registration of the package extension with lib\+S\+B\+ML. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
