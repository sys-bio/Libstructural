\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
In S\+B\+ML Level~1, the different rule types each have a different name for the attribute holding the reference to the object constituting the left-\/hand side of the rule. (E.\+g., for S\+B\+ML Level~1\textquotesingle{}s Species\+Concentration\+Rule the attribute is \char`\"{}species\char`\"{}, for Compartment\+Volume\+Rule it is \char`\"{}compartment\char`\"{}, etc.) In S\+B\+ML Levels~2 and~3, the only two types of \hyperlink{class_rule}{Rule} objects with a left-\/hand side object reference are \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule}, and both of them use the same name for attribute\+: \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}. In order to make it easier for application developers to work with all Levels of S\+B\+ML, lib\+S\+B\+ML uses a uniform name for all such attributes, and it is \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{}, regardless of whether Level~1 rules or Level~2--3 rules are being used.
