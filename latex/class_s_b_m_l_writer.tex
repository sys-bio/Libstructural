\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} File and text-\/string S\+B\+ML writer.



The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_writer}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Writer} class is the converse of \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reader}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader}, and provides the main interface for serializing S\+B\+ML models into X\+ML and writing the result to an output stream or to files and text strings. The methods for writing S\+B\+ML all take an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object and a destination. They return a boolean or integer value to indicate success or failure.\hypertarget{class_s_b_m_l_writer_sbmlwriter-compression}{}\subsection{Support for writing compressed files}\label{class_s_b_m_l_writer_sbmlwriter-compression}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides support for writing (as well as reading) compressed S\+B\+ML files. The process is transparent to the calling application---the application does not need to do anything deliberate to invoke the functionality. If a given S\+B\+ML filename ends with an extension for the {\itshape gzip}, {\itshape zip} or {\itshape bzip2} compression formats (respectively, {\ttfamily ".gz"}, {\ttfamily ".zip"}, or {\ttfamily ".bz2"}), then the methods S\+B\+M\+L\+Writer\+::write\+S\+B\+M\+L() and S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader\+::read\+S\+B\+M\+L() will automatically compress and decompress the file while writing and reading it. If the filename has no such extension, it will be written and read uncompressed as normal.

The compression feature requires that the {\itshape zlib} (for {\itshape gzip} and {\itshape zip} formats) and/or {\itshape bzip2} (for {\itshape bzip2} format) be available on the system running lib\+S\+B\+ML, and that lib\+S\+B\+ML was configured with their support compiled-\/in. Please see the lib\+S\+B\+ML for more information about this. The methods S\+B\+M\+L\+Writer\+::has\+Zlib() and S\+B\+M\+L\+Writer\+::has\+Bzip2() can be used by an application to query at run-\/time whether support for the compression libraries is available in the present copy of lib\+S\+B\+ML.

Support for compression is not mandated by the S\+B\+ML standard, but applications may find it helpful, particularly when large S\+B\+ML models are being communicated across data links of limited bandwidth.
