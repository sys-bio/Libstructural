\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This setting affects whether the \textquotesingle{}\textquotesingle{} symbol (modulo) is parsed as a piecewise equation that returns the modulo value of the entries on either side of the symbol, or whether it is parsed as the Math\+ML \textquotesingle{}rem\textquotesingle{} function, which was allowed in S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, but not in previous level/versions. The latter is more succinct, but might not be legal S\+B\+ML for the desired target S\+B\+ML document.
