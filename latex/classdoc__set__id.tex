\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The string {\ttfamily sid} is copied.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The identifier given by an object\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attribute value is used to identify the object within the S\+B\+ML model definition. Other objects can refer to the component using this identifier. The data type of \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} is always {\ttfamily S\+Id} or a type derived from that, such as {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id}, depending on the object in question. All data types are defined as follows\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
     letter ::= 'a'..'z','A'..'Z'
     digit  ::= '0'..'9'
     idChar ::= letter | digit | '\_'
     SId    ::= ( letter | '\_' ) idChar*
   \end{DoxyPre}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
The characters {\ttfamily (} and {\ttfamily )} are used for grouping, the character {\ttfamily $\ast$} \char`\"{}zero or more times\char`\"{}, and the character {\ttfamily $\vert$} indicates logical \char`\"{}or\char`\"{}. The equality of S\+B\+ML identifiers is determined by an exact character sequence match; i.\+e., comparisons must be performed in a case-\/sensitive manner. This applies to all uses of {\ttfamily S\+Id}, {\ttfamily S\+Id\+Ref}, and derived types.

In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, the \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attributes were moved to \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} directly, instead of being defined individually for many (but not all) objects. Libsbml has for a long time provided functions defined on \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} itself to get, set, check, and unset those attributes, which would fail or otherwise return empty strings if executed on any object for which those attributes were not defined. Now that all \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} objects define those attributes, those functions now succeed for any object with the appropriate level and version.

The exception to this rule is that for \hyperlink{class_initial_assignment}{Initial\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment}, \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule}, and \hyperlink{class_rate_rule}{Rate\+Rule} objects, the get\+Id() function and the is\+Set\+Id() functions (though not the set\+Id() or unset\+Id() functions) would instead reference the value of the \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} attribute (for the rules and event assignments) or the \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{} attribute (for initial assignments). The \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule} fell into this category as well, though because it contained neither a \char`\"{}variable\char`\"{} nor a \char`\"{}symbol\char`\"{} attribute, get\+Id() would always return an empty string, and is\+Set\+Id() would always return {\ttfamily false}. For this reason, four new functions are now provided (get\+Id\+Attribute(), set\+Id\+Attribute(), is\+Set\+Id\+Attribute(), and unset\+Id\+Attribute()) that will always act on the actual \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attribute, regardless of the object\textquotesingle{}s type. The new functions should be used instead of the old ones unless the old behavior is somehow necessary.

Regardless of the level and version of the S\+B\+ML, these functions allow client applications to use more generalized code in some situations (for instance, when manipulating objects that are all known to have identifiers). If the object in question does not posess an \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attribute according to the S\+B\+ML specification for the Level and Version in use, lib\+S\+B\+ML will not allow the identifier to be set, nor will it read or write \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attributes for those objects.
