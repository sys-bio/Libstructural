\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
In versions of S\+B\+ML Level~2 before Version~3, the class \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} included an attribute called \char`\"{}spatial\+Size\+Units\char`\"{}, which allowed explicitly setting the units of size for initial concentration. This attribute was removed in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~3. Lib\+S\+B\+ML retains this attribute for compatibility with older definitions of Level~2, but its use is strongly discouraged because it is incompatible with Level~2 Version~3 and Level~2 Version~4.
