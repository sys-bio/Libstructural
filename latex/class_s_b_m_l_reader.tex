\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} File and text-\/string S\+B\+ML reader.



The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reader}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader} class provides the main interface for reading S\+B\+ML content from files and strings. The methods for reading S\+B\+ML all return an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object representing the results. In the case of failures (such as if the S\+B\+ML contains errors or a file cannot be read), the errors will be recorded with the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} object kept in the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} returned by \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reader}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader}. Consequently, immediately after calling a method on \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reader}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader}, callers should always check for errors and warnings using the methods for this purpose provided by \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document}.

For convenience as well as easy access from other languages besides C++, this file also defines two global functions, \{read\+S\+B\+ML, String\} and \{read\+S\+B\+M\+L\+From\+String, String\}. They are equivalent to creating an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reader}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader} object and then calling the and methods, respectively.\hypertarget{class_s_b_m_l_reader_compression}{}\subsection{Support for reading compressed files}\label{class_s_b_m_l_reader_compression}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides support for reading (as well as writing) compressed S\+B\+ML files. The process is transparent to the calling application---the application does not need to do anything deliberate to invoke the functionality. If a given S\+B\+ML filename ends with an extension for the {\itshape gzip}, {\itshape zip} or {\itshape bzip2} compression formats (respectively, {\ttfamily }.gz, {\ttfamily }.zip, or {\ttfamily }.bz2), then the methods and

will automatically decompress and compress the file while reading and writing it. If the filename has no such extension, it will be read and written uncompressed as normal.

The compression feature requires that the {\itshape zlib} (for {\itshape gzip} and {\itshape zip} formats) and/or {\itshape bzip2} (for {\itshape bzip2} format) be available on the system running lib\+S\+B\+ML, and that lib\+S\+B\+ML was configured with their support compiled-\/in. Please see the lib\+S\+B\+ML \href{libsbml-installation.html}{\tt installation instructions} for more information about this. The methods has\+Zlib() and has\+Bzip2() can be used by an application to query at run-\/time whether support for the compression libraries is available in the present copy of lib\+S\+B\+ML.

Support for compression is not mandated by the S\+B\+ML standard, but applications may find it helpful, particularly when large S\+B\+ML models are being communicated across data links of limited bandwidth.
