\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The optional attribute named \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{}, present on every major S\+B\+ML component type, is for supporting metadata annotations using R\+DF (\href{http://www.w3.org/RDF/}{\tt Resource Description Format}). The attribute value has the data type \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id}{\tt X\+ML {\ttfamily ID}}, the X\+ML identifier type, which means each \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} value must be globally unique within an S\+B\+ML file. The latter point is important, because the uniqueness criterion applies across {\itshape any} attribute with type {\ttfamily ID} anywhere in the file, not just the \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} attribute used by S\+B\+ML---something to be aware of if your application-\/specific X\+ML content inside the \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} subelement happens to use the X\+ML {\ttfamily ID} type. Although S\+B\+ML itself specifies the use of \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#id}{\tt X\+ML {\ttfamily ID}} only for the \char`\"{}metaid\char`\"{} attribute, S\+B\+M\+L-\/compatible applications should be careful if they use X\+ML {\ttfamily ID}\textquotesingle{}s in X\+ML portions of a model that are not defined by S\+B\+ML, such as in the application-\/specific content of the \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} subelement. Finally, note that Lib\+S\+B\+ML does not provide an explicit X\+ML {\ttfamily ID} data type; it uses ordinary character strings, which is easier for applications to support.
