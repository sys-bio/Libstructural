\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Base class for extending S\+B\+ML components



\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This class is used as part of the mechanism that connects plugin objects (implemented using \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin}{S\+Base\+Plugin} or \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document_plugin}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+Plugin}) to a given package extension. For instance, an implementation of an extended version of \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} (e.\+g., Layout\+Model\+Plugin in the Layout package) would involve the creation of an extension point using \hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{S\+Base\+Extension\+Point} and a mediator object created using \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin_creator}{S\+Base\+Plugin\+Creator}, to \char`\"{}plug\char`\"{} the extended \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object (Layout\+Model\+Plugin) into the overall Layout\+Extension object.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
The use of \hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{S\+Base\+Extension\+Point} is relatively straightforward. The class needs to be used for each extended S\+B\+ML object implemented using \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document_plugin}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+Plugin} or \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin}{S\+Base\+Plugin}. Doing so requires knowing just two things\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The short-\/form name of the {\itshape parent} package being extended. The parent package is often simply core S\+B\+ML, identified in lib\+S\+B\+ML by the nickname {\ttfamily \char`\"{}core\char`\"{}}, but a S\+B\+ML Level~3 package could conceivably extend another Level~3 package.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The lib\+S\+B\+ML type code assigned to the object being extended. For example, if an extension of \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} is implemented, the relevant type code is S\+B\+M\+L\+Type\+Code\+\_\+t\+::\+S\+B\+M\+L\+\_\+\+M\+O\+D\+EL, found in \hyperlink{_s_b_m_l_type_codes_8h_aa283dddfd7671179362b2f38e2938cfe}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Type\+Code\+\_\+t}.\end{DoxyItemize}
The typical use of \hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{S\+Base\+Extension\+Point} is illustrated by the following code fragment\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{SBaseExtensionPoint} docExtPoint(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"core"}, \hyperlink{_s_b_m_l_type_codes_8h_aa283dddfd7671179362b2f38e2938cfeabfe976c674a5a708c1373dfdfa3bfa63}{SBML\_DOCUMENT});
\hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{SBaseExtensionPoint} modelExtPoint(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"core"}, \hyperlink{_s_b_m_l_type_codes_8h_aa283dddfd7671179362b2f38e2938cfea3c866be107d7858b6dd1e978ed103028}{SBML\_MODEL});

\hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin_creator}{SBasePluginCreator<GroupsSBMLDocumentPlugin, GroupsExtension>}
       docPluginCreator(docExtPoint, pkgURIs);
\hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin_creator}{SBasePluginCreator<GroupsModelPlugin, GroupsExtension>}
       modelPluginCreator(modelExtPoint, pkgURIs);
\end{DoxyCode}


The code above shows two core S\+B\+ML components being extended\+: the document object, and the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object. These extended objects are created elsewhere (not shown) as the {\ttfamily Groups\+S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+Plugin} and {\ttfamily Groups\+Model\+Plugin} objects. The corresponding \hyperlink{class_s_base_extension_point}{S\+Base\+Extension\+Point} objects are handed as arguments to the constructor for \hyperlink{class_s_base_plugin_creator}{S\+Base\+Plugin\+Creator} to create the connection between the extended core components and the overall package extension (here, for the Groups package, with the {\ttfamily Groups\+Extension} object).

The code above is typically placed in the implementation of the {\ttfamily init()} method of the package class derived from \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension}. (For the example above, it would be in the {\ttfamily Groups\+Extension.\+cpp} file.) 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
