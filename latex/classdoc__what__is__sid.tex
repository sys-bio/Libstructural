\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
In S\+B\+ML, identifiers that are the values of \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attributes on objects must conform to a data type called {\ttfamily S\+Id} in the S\+B\+ML specifications. Lib\+S\+B\+ML does not provide an explicit {\ttfamily S\+Id} data type; it uses ordinary character strings, which is easier for applications to support. (Lib\+S\+B\+ML does, however, test for identifier validity at various times, such as when reading in models from files and data streams.)
