\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Definitions of \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} in S\+B\+ML Level 2 Versions~1 and~2 included the additional attribute called \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{}, but it was removed in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~3. Lib\+S\+B\+ML supports this attribute for compatibility with previous versions of S\+B\+ML Level~2, but its use is discouraged since models in Level~2 Versions~3 and~4 cannot contain it. If a Version~3 or~4 model sets the attribute, the consistency-\/checking method S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency() will report an error.
