\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The lib\+S\+B\+ML system for unit analysis depends on the model as a whole. In cases where the \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object has not yet been added to a model, or the model itself is incomplete, unit analysis is not possible, and consequently this method will return {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL}.
