\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The \char`\"{}units\char`\"{} attribute is defined only in S\+B\+ML Level~1. In S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3, it has been replaced by a combination of \char`\"{}substance\+Units\char`\"{} and the units of the \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} object in which a species is located. In S\+B\+ML Level~2 Versions~1--2, an additional attribute \char`\"{}spatial\+Size\+Units\char`\"{} helps determine the units of the species quantity, but this attribute was removed in later versions of S\+B\+ML Level~2.
