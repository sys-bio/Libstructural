\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
S\+B\+ML Level~3 requires that every package defines an attribute named \char`\"{}required\char`\"{} on the root {\ttfamily $<$sbml$>$} element in an S\+B\+ML file or data stream. The attribute, being in the namespace of the Level~3 package in question, must be prefixed by the X\+ML namespace prefix associated with the package. The value of the \char`\"{}required\char`\"{} attribute indicates whether constructs in that package may change the mathematical interpretation of constructs defined in S\+B\+ML Level~3 Core. A \char`\"{}required\char`\"{} value of {\ttfamily true} indicates that the package may do so. The value of the attribute is set by the Level~3 package specification, and does {\itshape not} depend on the actual presence or absence of particular package constructs in a given S\+B\+ML document\+: in other words, if the package specification defines any construct that can change the model\textquotesingle{}s meaning, the value of the \char`\"{}required\char`\"{} attribute must always be set to {\ttfamily true} in any S\+B\+ML document that uses the package.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
The X\+ML namespace declaration for an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package is an indication that a model makes use of features defined by that package, while the \char`\"{}required\char`\"{} attribute indicates whether the features may be ignored without compromising the mathematical meaning of the model. Both are necessary for a complete reference to an S\+B\+ML Level~3 package.
