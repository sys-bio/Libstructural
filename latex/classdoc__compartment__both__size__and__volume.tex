\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
In S\+B\+ML Level~1, compartments are always three-\/dimensional constructs and only have volumes, whereas in S\+B\+ML Level~2 and higher, compartments may be other than three-\/dimensional, and therefore the \char`\"{}volume\char`\"{} attribute is named \char`\"{}size\char`\"{} in Level~2 and above. Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides both get\+Size() and get\+Volume() for easier support of different S\+B\+ML Levels.
