\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Registry of all lib\+S\+B\+ML S\+B\+ML converters.



Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides facilities for transforming and converting S\+B\+ML documents in various ways. These transformations can involve essentially anything that can be written algorithmically; examples include converting the units of measurement in a model, or converting from one Level+\+Version combination of S\+B\+ML to another. Converters are implemented as objects derived from the class \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Converter}.

The converter registry, implemented as a singleton object of class \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_converter_registry}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Converter\+Registry}, maintains a list of known converters and provides methods for discovering them. Callers can use the method S\+B\+M\+L\+Converter\+Registry\+::get\+Num\+Converters() to find out how many converters are registered, then use S\+B\+M\+L\+Converter\+Registry\+::get\+Converter\+By\+Index() to iterate over each one; alternatively, callers can use S\+B\+M\+L\+Converter\+Registry\+::get\+Converter\+For() to search for a converter having specific properties.
