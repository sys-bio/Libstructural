\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
S\+B\+ML Level~3 defines a symbol for representing the value of Avogadro\textquotesingle{}s constant, but it is not defined in S\+B\+ML Level~2. As a result, the text-\/string formula parser must behave differently depending on which S\+B\+ML Level is being targeted. For Level~3 documents, it can interpret instances of {\ttfamily avogadro} in the input as a reference to the Math\+ML {\itshape csymbol} for Avogadro\textquotesingle{}s constant defined in the S\+B\+ML Level~3 specification. For Level~2, it must treat {\ttfamily avogadro} as just another plain symbol.
