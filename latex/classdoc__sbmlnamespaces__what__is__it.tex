\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} objects are used in lib\+S\+B\+ML to communicate S\+B\+ML Level and Version data between constructors and other methods. The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object class holds triples consisting of S\+B\+ML Level, Version, and the corresponding S\+B\+ML X\+ML namespace. Most constructors for S\+B\+ML objects in lib\+S\+B\+ML take a \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object as an argument, thereby allowing the constructor to produce the proper combination of attributes and other internal data structures for the given S\+B\+ML Level and Version.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
The plural name (\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces}) is not a mistake, because in S\+B\+ML Level~3, objects may have extensions added by Level~3 packages used by a given model and therefore may have multiple namespaces associated with them. In S\+B\+ML Levels below Level~3, the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object only records one S\+B\+ML Level/\+Version/namespace combination at a time. Most constructors for S\+B\+ML objects in lib\+S\+B\+ML take a \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object as an argument, thereby allowing the constructor to produce the proper combination of attributes and other internal data structures for the given S\+B\+ML Level and Version.
