\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} A {\itshape compartment type} in S\+B\+ML Level~2.

S\+B\+ML Level~2 Versions~2--4 provide the {\itshape compartment type} as a grouping construct that can be used to establish a relationship between multiple \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} objects. A \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} object only has an identity, and this identity can only be used to indicate that particular \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment} objects in the model belong to this type. This may be useful for conveying a modeling intention, such as when a model contains many similar compartments, either by their biological function or the reactions they carry. Without a compartment type construct, it would be impossible within S\+B\+ML itself to indicate that all of the compartments share an underlying conceptual relationship because each S\+B\+ML compartment must be given a unique and separate identity. A \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} has no mathematical meaning in S\+B\+ML---it has no effect on a model\textquotesingle{}s mathematical interpretation. Simulators and other numerical analysis software may ignore \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} definitions and references to them in a model.

There is no mechanism in S\+B\+ML Level 2 for representing hierarchies of compartment types. One \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} instance cannot be the subtype of another \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} instance; S\+B\+ML provides no means of defining such relationships.

As with other major structures in S\+B\+ML, \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} has a mandatory attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, used to give the compartment type an identifier. The identifier must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax permitted in S\+B\+ML. \hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} also has an optional \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} attribute, of type {\ttfamily string}. The \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} must be used according to the guidelines described in the S\+B\+ML specification (e.\+g., Section 3.\+3 in the Level 2 Version 4 specification).

\hyperlink{class_compartment_type}{Compartment\+Type} was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level 2 Version 2. It is not available in S\+B\+ML Level~1 nor in Level~3.
