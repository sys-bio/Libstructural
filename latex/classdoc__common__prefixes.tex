\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages are often identified by their nicknames or short-\/form names (e.\+g., \char`\"{}comp\char`\"{} for the Hierarchical Model Composition package). The same text string is often used as the X\+ML namespace prefix when writing out the package constructs to an X\+ML file. Since this convention is so common, the lib\+S\+B\+ML A\+PI often uses the prefix as a convenient way to refer to the package.
