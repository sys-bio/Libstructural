\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Attempting to add an object to an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} having a different combination of S\+B\+ML Level, Version and X\+ML namespaces than the object itself will result in an error at the time a caller attempts to make the addition. A parent object must have compatible Level, Version and X\+ML namespaces. (Strictly speaking, a parent may also have more X\+ML namespaces than a child, but the reverse is not permitted.) The restriction is necessary to ensure that an S\+B\+ML model has a consistent overall structure. This requires callers to manage their objects carefully, but the benefit is increased flexibility in how models can be created by permitting callers to create objects bottom-\/up if desired. In situations where objects are not yet attached to parents (e.\+g., \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document}), knowledge of the intented S\+B\+ML Level and Version help lib\+S\+B\+ML determine such things as whether it is valid to assign a particular value to an attribute.
