{\ttfamily \#include $<$S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Reads an S\+B\+ML document from a text string.

This method is flexible with respect to the presence of an X\+ML declaration at the beginning of the string. In particular, if the string in {\ttfamily xml} does not begin with the X\+ML declaration \begin{DoxyVerb}<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
\end{DoxyVerb}
 then this method will automatically prepend the declaration to {\ttfamily xml}.

This method will log a fatal error if the content given in the parameter {\ttfamily xml} is not in S\+B\+ML format. See the method documentation for S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader\+::read\+S\+B\+M\+L() for an example of code for testing the returned error code.
