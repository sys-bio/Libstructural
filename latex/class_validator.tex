\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Entry point for S\+B\+ML validation rules in lib\+S\+B\+ML.



Lib\+S\+B\+ML implements facilities for verifying that a given S\+B\+ML document is valid according to the S\+B\+ML specifications; it also exposes the validation interface so that user programs and S\+B\+ML Level~3 package authors may use the facilities to implement new validators. There are two main interfaces to lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s validation facilities, based on the classes \hyperlink{class_validator}{Validator} and \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator}.

The \hyperlink{class_validator}{Validator} class is the basis of the system for validating an S\+B\+ML document against the validation rules defined in the S\+B\+ML specifications. The scheme used by \hyperlink{class_validator}{Validator} relies is compact and uses the {\itshape visitor} programming pattern, but it relies on C/\+C++ features and is not directly accessible from language bindings. \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator} offers a framework for straightforward class-\/based extensibility, so that user code can subclass \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator} to implement new validation systems, different validators can be introduced or turned off at run-\/time, and interfaces can be provided in the lib\+S\+B\+ML language bindings. \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator} can call \hyperlink{class_validator}{Validator} functionality internally (as is the case in the current implementation of \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_internal_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Internal\+Validator}) or use entirely different implementation approaches, as necessary. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
