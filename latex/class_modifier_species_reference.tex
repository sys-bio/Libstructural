\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} A reference to an S\+B\+ML {\itshape modifier species}.

Sometimes a species appears in the kinetic rate formula of a reaction but is itself neither created nor destroyed in that reaction (for example, because it acts as a catalyst or inhibitor). In S\+B\+ML, all such species are simply called {\itshape modifiers} without regard to the detailed role of those species in the model. The \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} structure provides a way to express which species act as modifiers in a given reaction. This is the purpose of the list of modifiers available in \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}. The list contains instances of \hyperlink{class_modifier_species_reference}{Modifier\+Species\+Reference} structures.

The \hyperlink{class_modifier_species_reference}{Modifier\+Species\+Reference} structure inherits the mandatory attribute \char`\"{}species\char`\"{} and optional attributes \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}name\char`\"{} from the parent class \hyperlink{class_simple_species_reference}{Simple\+Species\+Reference}. See the description of \hyperlink{class_simple_species_reference}{Simple\+Species\+Reference} for more information about these.

The value of the \char`\"{}species\char`\"{} attribute must be the identifier of a species defined in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}; this species is designated as a modifier for the current reaction. A reaction may have any number of modifiers. It is permissible for a modifier species to appear simultaneously in the list of reactants and products of the same reaction where it is designated as a modifier, as well as to appear in the list of reactants, products and modifiers of other reactions in the model.
