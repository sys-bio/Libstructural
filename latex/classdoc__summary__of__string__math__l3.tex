\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The text-\/string form of mathematical formulas read by the function \{parse\+L3\+Formula, String\} and written by the function \{formula\+To\+L3\+String, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\} uses an expanded version of the syntax read and written by \{parse\+Formula, String\} and \{formula\+To\+String, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\}, respectively. The latter two lib\+S\+B\+ML functions were originally developed to support conversion between S\+B\+ML Levels~1 and~2, and were focused on the syntax of mathematical formulas used in S\+B\+ML Level~1. With time, and the use of Math\+ML in S\+B\+ML Levels~2 and~3, it became clear that supporting Level~2 and~3\textquotesingle{}s expanded mathematical syntax would be useful for software developers. To maintain backwards compatibility for lib\+S\+B\+ML users, the original \{formula\+To\+String, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\} and \{parse\+Formula, String\} have been left untouched, and instead, the new functionality is provided in the form of \{parse\+L3\+Formula, String\} and \{formula\+To\+L3\+String, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\}.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
The following lists the main differences in the formula syntax supported by the \char`\"{}\+Level 3\char`\"{} or L3 versions of the formula parsers and formatters, compared to what is supported by the Level~1-\/oriented \{parse\+Formula, String\} and \{formula\+To\+String, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\}\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Units may be asociated with bare numbers, using the following syntax\+:  number unit  The number may be in any form (an integer, real, or rational number), and the unit must conform to the syntax of an S\+B\+ML identifier (technically, the type defined as {\ttfamily S\+Id} in the S\+B\+ML specifications). The whitespace between number and unit is optional.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The Boolean function symbols {\ttfamily \&\&}, {\ttfamily $\vert$$\vert$}, {\ttfamily !}, and {\ttfamily !=} may be used.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The {\itshape modulo} operation is allowed as the symbol {\ttfamily \%} and will produce a {\ttfamily $<$piecewise$>$} function in the corresponding Math\+ML output.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All inverse trigonometric functions may be defined in the infix either using {\ttfamily arc} as a prefix or simply {\ttfamily a}; in other words, both {\ttfamily arccsc} and {\ttfamily acsc} are interpreted as the operator {\itshape arccosecant} as defined in Math\+ML~2.\+0. (Many functions in the simpler S\+B\+ML Level~1 oriented parser implemented by \{parse\+Formula, String\} are defined this way as well, but not all.)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The following expression is parsed as a rational number instead of as a numerical division\+: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
   (integer/integer)\end{DoxyPre}
 {\bfseries Spaces are not allowed} in this construct; in other words, "{\ttfamily (3 / 4)}" (with whitespace between the numbers and the operator) will be parsed into the Math\+ML {\ttfamily $<$divide$>$} construct rather than a rational number. You can, however, assign units to a rational number as a whole; here is an example\+: "{\ttfamily (3/4) ml}". (In the case of division rather than a rational number, units are not interpreted in this way.)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Various parser and formatter behaviors may be altered through the use of a \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings} object in conjunction with the functions \{parse\+L3\+Formula\+With\+Settings, String\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings}\} and \{formula\+To\+L3\+String\+With\+Settings, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings}\} The settings available include the following\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The function {\ttfamily log} with a single argument ("{\ttfamily log(x)}") can be parsed as {\ttfamily log10(x)}, {\ttfamily ln(x)}, or treated as an error, as desired.


\item Unary minus signs can be collapsed or preserved; that is, sequential pairs of unary minuses (e.\+g., "{\ttfamily -\/ -\/3}") can be removed from the input entirely and single unary minuses can be incorporated into the number node, or all minuses can be preserved in the A\+ST node structure.


\item Parsing of units embedded in the input string can be turned on and off.


\item The string {\ttfamily avogadro} can be parsed as a Math\+ML {\itshape csymbol} or as an identifier.


\item A \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object may optionally be provided to the parser using the variant function call \{parse\+L3\+Formula\+With\+Model, String\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}\} or stored in a \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings} object passed to the variant function \{parse\+L3\+Formula\+With\+Settings, String\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings}\}. When a \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object is provided, identifiers (values of type {\ttfamily S\+Id}) from that model are used in preference to pre-\/defined Math\+ML definitions for both symbols and functions. More precisely\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape In the case of symbols}\+: the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} entities whose identifiers will shadow identical symbols in the mathematical formula are\+: \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}, \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}, and \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference}. For instance, if the parser is given a \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} containing a \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} with the identifier "{\ttfamily pi}", and the formula to be parsed is "{\ttfamily 3$\ast$pi}", the Math\+ML produced will contain the construct {\ttfamily $<$ci$>$ pi $<$/ci$>$} instead of the construct {\ttfamily $<$pi/$>$}.


\item {\itshape In the case of user-\/defined functions}\+: when a \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object is provided, {\ttfamily S\+Id} values of user-\/defined functions present in the model will be used preferentially over pre-\/defined Math\+ML functions. For example, if the passed-\/in \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} contains a \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} object with the identifier "{\ttfamily sin}", that function will be used instead of the predefined Math\+ML function {\ttfamily $<$sin/$>$}. 
\end{DoxyItemize}


\item An \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object may optionally be provided to identify S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages that extend the syntax understood by the formula parser. When the namespaces are provided, the parser will interpret possible additional syntax defined by the lib\+S\+B\+ML plug-\/ins implementing the S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages; for example, it may understand vector/array extensions introduced by the S\+B\+ML Level~3 {\itshape Arrays} package. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\end{DoxyItemize}
These configuration settings cannot be changed directly using the basic parser and formatter functions, but {\itshape can} be changed on a per-\/call basis by using the alternative functions \{parse\+L3\+Formula\+With\+Settings, String\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings}\} and \{formula\+To\+L3\+String\+With\+Settings, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node}\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings}\}.

Neither S\+B\+ML nor the Math\+ML standard define a \char`\"{}string-\/form\char`\"{} equivalent to Math\+ML expressions. The approach taken by lib\+S\+B\+ML is to start with the formula syntax defined by S\+B\+ML Level~1 (which in fact used a custom text-\/string representation of formulas, and not Math\+ML), and expand it to include the functionality described above. This formula syntax is based mostly on C programming syntax, and may contain operators, function calls, symbols, and white space characters. The following table provides the precedence rules for the different entities that may appear in formula strings.



In the table above, {\itshape operand} implies the construct is an operand, {\itshape prefix} implies the operation is applied to the following arguments, {\itshape unary} implies there is one argument, and {\itshape binary} implies there are two arguments. The values in the {\bfseries Precedence} column show how the order of different types of operation are determined. For example, the expression {\ttfamily a + b $\ast$ c} is evaluated as {\ttfamily a + (b $\ast$ c)} because the {\ttfamily $\ast$} operator has higher precedence. The {\bfseries Associates} column shows how the order of similar precedence operations is determined; for example, {\ttfamily a \&\& b $\vert$$\vert$ c} is evaluated as {\ttfamily (a \&\& b) $\vert$$\vert$ c} because the {\ttfamily \&\&} and {\ttfamily $\vert$$\vert$} operators are left-\/associative and have the same precedence.

The function call syntax consists of a function name, followed by optional white space, followed by an opening parenthesis token, followed by a sequence of zero or more arguments separated by commas (with each comma optionally preceded and/or followed by zero or more white space characters), followed by a closing parenthesis token. The function name must be chosen from one of the pre-\/defined functions in S\+B\+ML or a user-\/defined function in the model. The following table lists the names of certain common mathematical functions; this table corresponds to Table~6 in the \href{http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications#SBML_Level_1_Version_2}{\tt S\+B\+ML Level~1 Version~2 specification} with additions based on the functions added in S\+B\+ML Level 2 and Level 3\+:



Parsing of the various Math\+ML functions and constants are all case-\/insensitive by default\+: function names such as {\ttfamily cos}, {\ttfamily Cos} and {\ttfamily C\+OS} are all parsed as the Math\+ML cosine operator, {\ttfamily $<$cos$>$}. However, {\itshape when a \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object is used} in conjunction with either \{parse\+L3\+Formula\+With\+Model, String\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}\} or \{parse\+L3\+Formula\+With\+Settings, String\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings}\}, any identifiers found in that model will be parsed in a case-\/{\itshape sensitive} way. For example, if a model contains a \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} having the identifier {\ttfamily Pi}, the parser will parse "{\ttfamily Pi}" in the input as "{\ttfamily $<$ci$>$ Pi $<$/ci$>$}" but will continue to parse the symbols "{\ttfamily pi}" and "{\ttfamily PI}" as "{\ttfamily $<$pi$>$}".

As mentioned above, the manner in which the \char`\"{}\+L3\char`\"{} versions of the formula parser and formatter interpret the function "{\ttfamily log}" can be changed. To do so, callers should use the function \{parse\+L3\+Formula\+With\+Settings, String\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings}\} and pass it an appropriate \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings} object. By default, unlike the S\+B\+ML Level~1 parser implemented by \{parse\+Formula, String\}, the string "{\ttfamily log}" is interpreted as the base~10 logarithm, and {\itshape not} as the natural logarithm. However, you can change the interpretation to be base-\/10 log, natural log, or as an error; since the name \char`\"{}log\char`\"{} by itself is ambiguous, you require that the parser uses {\ttfamily log10} or {\ttfamily ln} instead, which are more clear. Please refer to \{parse\+L3\+Formula\+With\+Settings, String\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings}\}.

In addition, the following symbols will be translated to their Math\+ML equivalents, if no symbol with the same {\ttfamily S\+Id} identifier string exists in the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object provided\+:



Again, as mentioned above, whether the string "{\ttfamily avogadro}" is parsed as an A\+ST node of type \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+M\+E\+\_\+\+A\+V\+O\+G\+A\+D\+RO, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\} or \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+ME, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\} is configurable; use the version of the parser function called \{parse\+L3\+Formula\+With\+Settings, String\textbackslash{}, \hyperlink{class_l3_parser_settings}{L3\+Parser\+Settings}\}. This Avogadro-\/related functionality is provided because S\+B\+ML Level~2 models may not use \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+M\+E\+\_\+\+A\+V\+O\+G\+A\+D\+RO, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\} A\+ST nodes.
