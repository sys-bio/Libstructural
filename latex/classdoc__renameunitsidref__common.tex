{\ttfamily \#include $<$common-\/documentation.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
Replaces all uses of a given {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id\+Ref} type attribute value with another value.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
In S\+B\+ML, unit definitions have identifiers of type {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id}. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, an explicit data type called {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id\+Ref} was introduced for attribute values that refer to {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id} values; in previous Levels of S\+B\+ML, this data type did not exist and attributes were simply described to as \char`\"{}referring to a unit identifier\char`\"{}, but the effective data type was the same as {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id\+Ref} in Level~3. These and other methods of lib\+S\+B\+ML refer to the type {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id\+Ref} for all Levels of S\+B\+ML, even if the corresponding S\+B\+ML specification did not explicitly name the data type.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
This method works by looking at all unit identifier attribute values (including, if appropriate, inside mathematical formulas), comparing the referenced unit identifiers to the value of {\ttfamily oldid}. If any matches are found, the matching values are replaced with {\ttfamily newid}. The method does {\itshape not} descend into child elements.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em oldid} & the old identifier. \\
\hline
{\em newid} & the new identifier. \\
