\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Set of S\+B\+ML Level + Version + namespace triples.



There are differences in the definitions of components between different S\+B\+ML Levels, as well as Versions within Levels. For example, the \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} attribute was not introduced until Level~2 Version~2, and then only on certain component classes; the S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~3 specification moved the \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} attribute to the \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} class, thereby allowing nearly all components to have \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} annotations. As a result of differences such as those, lib\+S\+B\+ML needs to track the S\+B\+ML Level and Version of every object created.

The purpose of the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object class is to make it easier to communicate S\+B\+ML Level and Version data between lib\+S\+B\+ML constructors and other methods. The \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object class tracks 3-\/tuples (triples) consisting of S\+B\+ML Level, Version, and the corresponding S\+B\+ML X\+ML namespace.

The plural name (\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces}) is not a mistake, because in S\+B\+ML Level~3, objects may have extensions added by Level~3 packages used by a given model and therefore may have multiple namespaces associated with them; however, until the introduction of S\+B\+ML Level~3, the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object only records one S\+B\+ML Level/\+Version/namespace combination at a time. Most constructors for S\+B\+ML objects in lib\+S\+B\+ML take a \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} object as an argument, thereby allowing the constructor to produce the proper combination of attributes and other internal data structures for the given S\+B\+ML Level and Version.
