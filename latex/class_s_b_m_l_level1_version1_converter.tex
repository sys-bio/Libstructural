\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Whole-\/document S\+B\+ML Level/\+Version converter.



This S\+B\+ML converter takes an S\+B\+ML document having one S\+B\+ML Level+\+Version combination, and attempts to convert it to an S\+B\+ML document having a different Level+\+Version combination. This converter (\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_level1_version1_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Level1\+Version1\+Converter}) converts models to S\+B\+ML Level~1 Version~1, to the extent possible by the limited features of that Level/\+Version combination of S\+B\+ML.\hypertarget{class_s_b_m_l_level1_version1_converter_SBMLLevel1Version1Converter-usage}{}\subsection{Configuration and use of S\+B\+M\+L\+Level1\+Version1\+Converter}\label{class_s_b_m_l_level1_version1_converter_SBMLLevel1Version1Converter-usage}
\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_level1_version1_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Level1\+Version1\+Converter} is enabled by creating a \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object with the option {\ttfamily \char`\"{}convert\+To\+L1\+V1\char`\"{}}, and passing this properties object to S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::convert(). The target S\+B\+ML Level and Version combination are determined by the value of the S\+B\+ML namespace set on the \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object (using Conversion\+Properties\+::set\+Target\+Namespaces(\+S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces $\ast$target\+N\+S)).

In addition, this converter offers the following options\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \char`\"{}change\+Pow\char`\"{}}\+: Mathematical expressions for exponentiation of the form {\ttfamily pow(s1, 2)} will be converted to the expression {\ttfamily s1$^\wedge$2}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \char`\"{}inline\+Compartment\+Sizes\char`\"{}}\+: Back in the days of S\+B\+ML Level~1 Version~1, many software tools assumed that the \char`\"{}kinetic laws\char`\"{} of S\+B\+ML were written in terms of units of {\itshape concentration}/{\itshape time}. These tools would not expect (and thus not handle) rate expressions such as {\ttfamily Compartment\+Of\+S1 $\ast$ k $\ast$ S1}. When the option {\ttfamily \char`\"{}inline\+Compartment\+Sizes\char`\"{}} is enabled, lib\+S\+B\+ML will replace the references to compartments (such as {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Compartment\+Of\+S1\char`\"{}} in this example) with their initial sizes. This is not strictly correct in all cases; in particular, if the compartment volume varies during simulation, this conversion will not reflect the expected behavior. However, many models do not have time-\/varying compartment sizes, so this option makes it easy to get modern S\+B\+ML rate expressions into a form that old software tools may better understand.\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_using-converters}{}\subsection{General information about the use of S\+B\+M\+L converters}\label{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_using-converters}
The use of all the converters follows a similar approach. First, one creates a \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object and calls Conversion\+Properties\+::add\+Option() on this object with one argument\+: a text string that identifies the desired converter. (The text string is specific to each converter; consult the documentation for a given converter to find out how it should be enabled.)

Next, for some converters, the caller can optionally set some converter-\/specific properties using additional calls to Conversion\+Properties\+::add\+Option(). Many converters provide the ability to configure their behavior to some extent; this is realized through the use of properties that offer different options. The default property values for each converter can be interrogated using the method S\+B\+M\+L\+Converter\+::get\+Default\+Properties() on the converter class in question .

Finally, the caller should invoke the method S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::convert() with the \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object as an argument.\hypertarget{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_converter-example}{}\subsubsection{Example of invoking an S\+B\+M\+L converter}\label{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_converter-example}
The following code fragment illustrates an example using \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reaction_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reaction\+Converter}, which is invoked using the option string {\ttfamily \char`\"{}replace\+Reactions\char`\"{}}\+:

In the case of \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reaction_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reaction\+Converter}, there are no options to affect its behavior, so the next step is simply to invoke the converter on an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object. Continuing the example code\+:

Here is an example of using a converter that offers an option. The following code invokes \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_strip_package_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Strip\+Package\+Converter} to remove the S\+B\+ML Level~3 {\itshape Layout} package from a model. It sets the name of the package to be removed by adding a value for the option named {\ttfamily \char`\"{}package\char`\"{}} defined by that converter\+:\hypertarget{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_available-converters}{}\subsubsection{Available S\+B\+M\+L converters in lib\+S\+B\+ML}\label{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_available-converters}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides a number of built-\/in converters; by convention, their names end in {\itshape Converter}. The following are the built-\/in converters provided by lib\+S\+B\+ML \+:
