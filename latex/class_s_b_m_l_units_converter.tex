\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Converts a model\textquotesingle{}s existing units to SI units.



This S\+B\+ML converter converts the units in a model to base SI units, that is, using only the units metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, mole and candela.

\hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} conversion will only be performed on models that are fully unit consistent, meaning that all objects have units associated with them and there are no literal numbers with unspecified units. In the case of an S\+B\+ML Level~3 model involving math expressions, this means that the {\ttfamily time\+Units} attribute on the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object must be set, and if there are any reactions in the model, the {\ttfamily extent\+Units} attribute on the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object must also be set.\hypertarget{class_s_b_m_l_units_converter_SBMLUnitsConverter-usage}{}\subsection{Configuration and use of S\+B\+M\+L\+Units\+Converter}\label{class_s_b_m_l_units_converter_SBMLUnitsConverter-usage}
\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_units_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Units\+Converter} is enabled by creating a \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object with the option {\ttfamily \char`\"{}units\char`\"{}}, and passing this properties object to S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::convert(). This converter takes one optional option\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \char`\"{}remove\+Unused\+Units\char`\"{}}\+: the value of this property should be a Boolean. If it is {\ttfamily true}, it tells the unit convert to remove any unused \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} objects after conversion is complete. (\char`\"{}\+Unused\char`\"{} units are units that are not referenced by any object in the model.) If the value is {\ttfamily false}, unused \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} objects are not removed from the model. The default is {\ttfamily true}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_using-converters}{}\subsection{General information about the use of S\+B\+M\+L converters}\label{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_using-converters}
The use of all the converters follows a similar approach. First, one creates a \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object and calls Conversion\+Properties\+::add\+Option() on this object with one argument\+: a text string that identifies the desired converter. (The text string is specific to each converter; consult the documentation for a given converter to find out how it should be enabled.)

Next, for some converters, the caller can optionally set some converter-\/specific properties using additional calls to Conversion\+Properties\+::add\+Option(). Many converters provide the ability to configure their behavior to some extent; this is realized through the use of properties that offer different options. The default property values for each converter can be interrogated using the method S\+B\+M\+L\+Converter\+::get\+Default\+Properties() on the converter class in question .

Finally, the caller should invoke the method S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::convert() with the \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object as an argument.\hypertarget{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_converter-example}{}\subsubsection{Example of invoking an S\+B\+M\+L converter}\label{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_converter-example}
The following code fragment illustrates an example using \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reaction_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reaction\+Converter}, which is invoked using the option string {\ttfamily \char`\"{}replace\+Reactions\char`\"{}}\+:

In the case of \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reaction_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reaction\+Converter}, there are no options to affect its behavior, so the next step is simply to invoke the converter on an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object. Continuing the example code\+:

Here is an example of using a converter that offers an option. The following code invokes \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_strip_package_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Strip\+Package\+Converter} to remove the S\+B\+ML Level~3 {\itshape Layout} package from a model. It sets the name of the package to be removed by adding a value for the option named {\ttfamily \char`\"{}package\char`\"{}} defined by that converter\+:\hypertarget{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_available-converters}{}\subsubsection{Available S\+B\+M\+L converters in lib\+S\+B\+ML}\label{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_available-converters}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides a number of built-\/in converters; by convention, their names end in {\itshape Converter}. The following are the built-\/in converters provided by lib\+S\+B\+ML \+:
