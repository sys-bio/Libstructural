\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
If a Member object within a Group object\textquotesingle{}s List\+Of\+Members references another Group object, it is the {\itshape referenced Group itself} that is considered to be a member of the parent Group, {\itshape not} the corresponding referenced model component(s). This is true regardless of whether those components themselves happen to point to other components using some mechanism defined by another S\+B\+ML Level~3 package (as happens, for example, in the S\+B\+ML Level~3 Hierarchical Model Composition package and its use of S\+Base\+Ref). However, if instead a Member object references a List\+Of\+Members object (using the \char`\"{}id\char`\"{} attribute permitted on List\+Of\+Members objects), it is the components of that List\+Of\+Members that are considered to be part of the parent Group. In other words\+: if in some Group {\itshape G}, a Member {\itshape M} references another Group, that Group is the member of {\itshape G}; if {\itshape M} references a List\+Of\+Members, it is the entities referenced by the Member objects within the List\+Of\+Members that are the members of {\itshape G} and not the List\+Of\+Members object itself.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
The implication of this is that any rule that applies to members of a group (such the meaning of the \char`\"{}kind\char`\"{} attribute, or the restrictions on the application of \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} attributes on a List\+Of\+Members) applies to the child group when referenced by the Group \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, and to the members of the child group when referenced by the List\+Of\+Members \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}. In an example situation where a parent group includes two \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} plus a Group which itself contains three other \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, if the parent group\textquotesingle{}s List\+Of\+Members is given an \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} attribute value, that \hyperlink{class_s_b_o}{S\+BO} term applies to the two species and the group, not to the three child species members of the second group. (Note also that in such a case, the parent group\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}kind\char`\"{} attribute value would almost certainly be {\ttfamily \char`\"{}collection\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily \char`\"{}partonomy\char`\"{}}, and not {\ttfamily \char`\"{}classification\char`\"{}}, as two species and a group are very unlikely to be classified as the same thing.) In contrast, in the situation where a parent group includes two \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} plus a List\+Of\+Members which contains three other \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, the parent group\textquotesingle{}s List\+Of\+Members \char`\"{}sbo\+Term\char`\"{} would apply to the five \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, and could be more reasonably marked as a {\ttfamily \char`\"{}classification\char`\"{}}.

In a future version of this S\+B\+ML Level~3 Groups specification, it may be possible to perform set operations on groups, but for now, this type of union is the only set operation that is possible.

Groups are not permitted to be circular\+: no Member may reference itself, its parent List\+Of\+Members, nor its parent Group. If a Member references a Group, the same restrictions apply to that subgroup\textquotesingle{}s children\+: they may not reference the Member, its parent List\+Of\+Members, nor its parent Group, and if any of those children reference a Group, the same restrictions apply to them, etc.

If a Member has a \char`\"{}id\+Ref\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}meta\+Id\+Ref\char`\"{} attribute which references an object from a namespace that is not understood by the interpreter of the S\+B\+ML model, that Member must be ignored. The referenced object will not be understood by the interpreter, and therefore has no need to become a member of the group. If an interpreter cannot tell whether a referenced object does not exist or if exists in an unparsed namespace, it may choose to produce a warning.
