\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The mechanism by which the last \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object in this model was created is not significant. It could have been created in a variety of ways, for example by using create\+Event(). If no \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} object exists in this \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object, a new \hyperlink{class_event_assignment}{Event\+Assignment} is {\itshape not} created and {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL} is returned instead.
