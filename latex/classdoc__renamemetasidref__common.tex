\subsection{Detailed Description}
Replaces all uses of a given meta identifier attribute value with another value.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
In S\+B\+ML, object \char`\"{}meta\char`\"{} identifiers are of the X\+ML data type {\ttfamily ID}; the S\+B\+ML object attribute itself is typically named {\ttfamily metaid}. All attributes that hold values {\itshape referring} to values of type {\ttfamily ID} are of the X\+ML data type {\ttfamily I\+D\+R\+EF}. They are also sometimes informally referred to as \char`\"{}metaid refs\char`\"{}, in analogy to the S\+B\+M\+L-\/defined type {\ttfamily S\+Id\+Ref}.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
This method works by looking at all meta-\/identifier attribute values, comparing the identifiers to the value of {\ttfamily oldid}. If any matches are found, the matching identifiers are replaced with {\ttfamily newid}. The method does {\itshape not} descend into child elements.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em oldid} & the old identifier. \\
\hline
{\em newid} & the new identifier. \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
