\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML attaches an identifying code to every kind of S\+B\+ML object. These are integer constants known as {\itshape S\+B\+ML type codes}. The names of all the codes begin with the characters {\ttfamily S\+B\+M\+L\+\_\+}. Note that different Level~3 package plug-\/ins may use overlapping type codes; to identify the package to which a given object belongs, call the {\ttfamily get\+Package\+Name()} method on the object.
