{\ttfamily \#include $<$A\+S\+T\+Node.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Although S\+B\+ML permits the use of the Math\+ML {\ttfamily $<$semantics$>$} annotation construct, the truth is that this construct has so far (at this time of this writing, which is early 2014) seen very little use in S\+B\+ML software. The full implications of using these annotations are still poorly understood. If you wish to use this construct, we urge you to discuss possible uses and applications on the S\+B\+ML discussion lists, particularly \href{http://sbml.org/Forums}{\tt sbml-\/discuss} and/or \href{http://sbml.org/Forums}{\tt sbml-\/interoperability}.
