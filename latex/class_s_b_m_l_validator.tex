\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Base class for S\+B\+ML validators.



Lib\+S\+B\+ML implements facilities for verifying that a given S\+B\+ML document is valid according to the S\+B\+ML specifications; it also exposes the validation interface so that user programs and S\+B\+ML Level~3 package authors may use the facilities to implement new validators. There are two main interfaces to lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s validation facilities, based on the classes \hyperlink{class_validator}{Validator} and \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator}.

The \hyperlink{class_validator}{Validator} class is the basis of the system for validating an S\+B\+ML document against the validation rules defined in the S\+B\+ML specifications. The scheme used by \hyperlink{class_validator}{Validator} relies is compact and uses the {\itshape visitor} programming pattern, but it relies on C/\+C++ features and is not directly accessible from language bindings. \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator} offers a framework for straightforward class-\/based extensibility, so that user code can subclass \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator} to implement new validation systems, different validators can be introduced or turned off at run-\/time, and interfaces can be provided in the lib\+S\+B\+ML language bindings. \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator} can call \hyperlink{class_validator}{Validator} functionality internally (as is the case in the current implementation of \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_internal_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Internal\+Validator}) or use entirely different implementation approaches, as necessary.

Users of lib\+S\+B\+ML may already be familiar with the facilities encompassed by the validation system, in the form of the consistency-\/checking methods defined on \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document}. The methods S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::set\+Consistency\+Checks(), S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Consistency(), S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::check\+Internal\+Consistency() and other method of that sort are in fact implemented via \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator}, specifically as methods on the class \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_internal_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Internal\+Validator}.

Authors may use \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Validator} as the base class for their own validator extensions to lib\+S\+B\+ML. The class \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_internal_validator}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Internal\+Validator} may serve as a code example for how to implement such things.
