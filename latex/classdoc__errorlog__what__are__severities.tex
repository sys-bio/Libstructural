\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML associates severity levels with every \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} object to provide an indication of how serious the problem is. Severities range from informational diagnostics to fatal (irrecoverable) errors. Given an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} object instance, a caller can interrogate it for its severity level using methods such as S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::get\+Severity(), S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+::is\+Fatal(), and so on. The present method encapsulates iteration and interrogation of all objects in an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error_log}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error\+Log}, making it easy to check for the presence of error objects with specific severity levels.
