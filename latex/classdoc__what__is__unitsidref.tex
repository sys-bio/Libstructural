\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
In S\+B\+ML, unit definitions have identifiers of type {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id}. In S\+B\+ML Level~3, an explicit data type called {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id\+Ref} was introduced for attribute values that refer to {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id} values; in previous Levels of S\+B\+ML, this data type did not exist and attributes were simply described to as \char`\"{}referring to a unit identifier\char`\"{}, but the effective data type was the same as {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id\+Ref} in Level~3. These and other methods of lib\+S\+B\+ML refer to the type {\ttfamily Unit\+S\+Id\+Ref} for all Levels of S\+B\+ML, even if the corresponding S\+B\+ML specification did not explicitly name the data type.
