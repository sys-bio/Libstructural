\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Whereas the S\+B\+ML \char`\"{}notes\char`\"{} subelement is a container for content to be shown directly to humans, the \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{} element is a container for optional software-\/generated content {\itshape not} meant to be shown to humans. Every object derived from \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} can have its own value for \char`\"{}annotation\char`\"{}. The element\textquotesingle{}s content type is \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xml-20040204/#elemdecls}{\tt X\+ML type \char`\"{}any\char`\"{}}, allowing essentially arbitrary well-\/formed X\+ML data content.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
S\+B\+ML places a few restrictions on the organization of the content of annotations; these are intended to help software tools read and write the data as well as help reduce conflicts between annotations added by different tools. Please see the S\+B\+ML specifications for more details.
