\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object may optionally be provided to use identifiers (values of type {\ttfamily S\+Id}) from the model in preference to pre-\/defined Math\+ML symbols More precisely, the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} entities whose identifiers will shadow identical symbols in the mathematical formula are\+: \hyperlink{class_species}{Species}, \hyperlink{class_compartment}{Compartment}, \hyperlink{class_parameter}{Parameter}, \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}, and \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference}. For instance, if the parser is given a \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} containing a \hyperlink{class_species}{Species} with the identifier "{\ttfamily pi}", and the formula to be parsed is "{\ttfamily 3$\ast$pi}", the Math\+ML produced by the parser will contain the construct {\ttfamily $<$ci$>$ pi $<$/ci$>$} instead of the construct {\ttfamily $<$pi/$>$}. Another example, if the passed-\/in \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} contains a \hyperlink{class_function_definition}{Function\+Definition} with the identifier "{\ttfamily sin}", that function will be used instead of the predefined Math\+ML function {\ttfamily $<$sin/$>$}. \item The function {\ttfamily log} with a single argument ("{\ttfamily log(x)}") can be parsed as {\ttfamily log10(x)}, {\ttfamily ln(x)}, or treated as an error, as desired. \item Unary minus signs can be either collapsed or preserved; that is, the parser can either (1) remove sequential pairs of unary minuses (e.\+g., "{\ttfamily -\/ -\/3}") from the input and incorporate single unary minuses into the number node, or (2) preserve all minuses in the A\+ST node structure, turning them into \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} objects of type \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+M\+I\+N\+US, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}. \item The character sequence "{\ttfamily number id}" can be interpreted as a numerical value {\ttfamily number} followed by units of measurement indicated by {\ttfamily id}, or it can be treated as a syntax error. (In Level~3, Math\+ML {\ttfamily $<$cn$>$} elements can have an attribute named {\ttfamily units} placed in the S\+B\+ML namespace, which can be used to indicate the units to be associated with the number. The text-\/string infix formula parser allows units to be placed after raw numbers; they are interpreted as unit identifiers for units defined by the S\+B\+ML specification or in the containing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object.) \item The symbol {\ttfamily avogadro} can be parsed either as a Math\+ML {\itshape csymbol} or as a identifier. More specifically, "{\ttfamily avogadro}" can be treated as an \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} of type \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+M\+E\+\_\+\+A\+V\+O\+G\+A\+D\+RO, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\} or of type \{A\+S\+T\+\_\+\+N\+A\+ME, A\+S\+T\+Node\+Type\+\_\+t\}. \item Strings that match built-\/in functions and constants can either be parsed as a match regardless of capitalization, or may be required to be all-\/lower-\/case to be considered a match. \item Lib\+S\+B\+ML plug-\/ins implementing support for S\+B\+ML Level~3 packages may introduce extensions to the syntax understood by the parser. The precise nature of the extensions will be documented by the individual package plug-\/ins. An example of a possible extension is a notation for vectors and arrays, introduced by the S\+B\+ML Level~3 {\itshape Arrays} package. \end{DoxyItemize}
