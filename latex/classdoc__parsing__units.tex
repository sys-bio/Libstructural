\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
In S\+B\+ML Level~2, there is no means of associating a unit of measurement with a pure number in a formula, while S\+B\+ML Level~3 does define a syntax for this. In Level~3, Math\+ML {\ttfamily $<$cn$>$} elements can have an attribute named {\ttfamily units} placed in the S\+B\+ML namespace, which can be used to indicate the units to be associated with the number. The text-\/string infix formula parser allows units to be placed after raw numbers; they are interpreted as unit identifiers for units defined by the S\+B\+ML specification or in the containing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object. Some examples include\+: "{\ttfamily 4 mL}", "{\ttfamily 2.\+01 Hz}", "{\ttfamily 3.\+1e-\/6 M}", and "{\ttfamily (5/8) inches}". To produce a valid S\+B\+ML model, there must either exist a \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} corresponding to the identifier of the unit, or the unit must be defined in Table~2 of the S\+B\+ML Level~3 specification.
