\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The date format expresses a date and time value as a string of the form Y\+Y\+Y\+Y-\/\+M\+M-\/\+D\+D\+Thh\+:mm\+:ss\+X\+HH\+:ZZ, where
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape Y\+Y\+YY} is a four-\/digit integer representing the year. This should be a four-\/digit number such as {\ttfamily 2011}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape MM} is a two-\/digit integer representing the month, with a range of values of 01--12. The value {\ttfamily 1} represents January, and so on.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape DD} is a two-\/digit integer representing the day of the month, with a range of values of 01--31.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape T} is the literal character {\ttfamily T}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape hh} is a two-\/digit integer representing the hour on a 24-\/hour clock, with a range of values of 00--23.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape mm} is a two-\/digit integer representing the minute, with a range of 00--59.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape ss} is a two-\/digit integer representing the second, with a range of 0--59.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape X} is the the sign of the time zone offset, either {\ttfamily +} or {\ttfamily -\/}.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape HH} is a two-\/digit integer representing the hour of the time zone offset, with a range of 00--23.\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape ZZ} is a two-\/digit integer representing the minutes of the time zone offset, with a range of 00--59.\end{DoxyItemize}
In the string format above, it is important not to forget the literal character {\ttfamily T} in the string. Here is an example date/time string\+: {\ttfamily 1997-\/07-\/16\+T19\+:20\+:30+01\+:00}, which would represent July 16, 1997, at 19\+:20\+:30 in Central European Time (which is U\+TC +1\+:00).
