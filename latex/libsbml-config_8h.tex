\subsection{Detailed Description}
Decides whether to \#include Unix or Windows configuration variables.

Some explanations about this file are warranted. This file includes one of the following (depending on operating system and compiler)\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily libsbml-\/config-\/unix.\+h}
\item {\ttfamily libsbml-\/config-\/win.\+h}
\end{DoxyItemize}

On Linux, Mac\+OS X, Cygwin, etc., {\ttfamily libsbml-\/config-\/unix.\+h} and {\ttfamily \hyperlink{libsbml-package_8h}{libsbml-\/package.\+h}} are generated from {\ttfamily libsbml-\/config-\/unix.\+h.\+in} and {\ttfamily libsbml-\/package.\+h.\+in}, respectively, by the {\ttfamily configure} script at the top level of the lib\+S\+B\+ML distribution.

On Windows, we cannot rely on {\ttfamily libsbml-\/config-\/win.\+h} being generated by {\ttfamily configure}, since most developers will not be able to run {\ttfamily configure} in that environment. Instead, both {\ttfamily libsbml-\/config-\/win.\+h} and {\ttfamily \hyperlink{libsbml-package_8h}{libsbml-\/package.\+h}} (which see) are stored in the source repository and must be updated by the lib\+S\+B\+ML developers as necessary. The file {\ttfamily libsbml-\/config-\/win.\+h} should rarely, if ever, need to be updated, while {\ttfamily \hyperlink{libsbml-package_8h}{libsbml-\/package.\+h}} should require minor updates prior to each libsbml release. This is admittedly not an ideal and fool-\/proof arrangement; however, at this time it is the best we have been able to find under the circumstances.

Finally, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{libsbml-config_8h}{libsbml-\/config.\+h}}, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{libsbml-package_8h}{libsbml-\/package.\+h}}, {\ttfamily libsbml-\/config-\/unix.\+h}, and (for consistency) {\ttfamily libsbml-\/config-\/win.\+h} are all installed by {\ttfamily \char`\"{}make install\char`\"{}}.
