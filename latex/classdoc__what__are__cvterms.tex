\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The S\+B\+ML Level~2 and Level~3 specifications define a simple format for annotating models when (a) referring to controlled vocabulary terms and database identifiers that define and describe biological and other entities, and (b) describing the creator of a model and the model\textquotesingle{}s modification history. The annotation content is stored in {\ttfamily $<$annotation$>$} elements attached to individual S\+B\+ML elements. The format for storing the content inside S\+B\+ML {\ttfamily $<$annotation$>$} elements is a subset of W3C R\+DF (\href{http://www.w3.org/RDF/}{\tt Resource Description Format}) expressed in X\+ML. The \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} class provides a programming interface for working directly with controlled vocabulary term (\char`\"{}\+C\+V
   term\char`\"{}) objects without having to deal directly with the X\+ML form. When lib\+S\+B\+ML reads in an S\+B\+ML model containing R\+DF annotations, it parses those annotations into a list of \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} objects, and when writing a model, it parses the \hyperlink{class_c_v_term}{C\+V\+Term} objects back into the appropriate S\+B\+ML {\ttfamily $<$annotation$>$} structure.
