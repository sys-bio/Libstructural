\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
In S\+B\+ML, object \char`\"{}meta\char`\"{} identifiers are of the X\+ML data type {\ttfamily ID}; the S\+B\+ML object attribute itself is typically named {\ttfamily metaid}. All attributes that hold values {\itshape referring} to values of type {\ttfamily ID} are of the X\+ML data type {\ttfamily I\+D\+R\+EF}. They are also sometimes informally referred to as \char`\"{}metaid refs\char`\"{}, in analogy to the S\+B\+M\+L-\/defined type {\ttfamily S\+Id\+Ref}.
