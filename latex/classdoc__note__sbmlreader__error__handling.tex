\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML versions 2.\+x and later versions behave differently in error handling in several respects. One difference is how early some errors are caught and whether lib\+S\+B\+ML continues processing a file in the face of some early errors. In general, lib\+S\+B\+ML versions after 2.\+x stop parsing S\+B\+ML inputs sooner than lib\+S\+B\+ML version 2.\+x in the face of X\+ML errors, because the errors may invalidate any further S\+B\+ML content. For example, a missing X\+ML declaration at the beginning of the file was ignored by lib\+S\+B\+ML 2.\+x but in version 3.\+x and later, it will cause lib\+S\+B\+ML to stop parsing the rest of the input altogether. While this behavior may seem more severe and intolerant, it was necessary in order to provide uniform behavior regardless of which underlying X\+ML parser (Expat, Xerces, libxml2) is being used by lib\+S\+B\+ML. The X\+ML parsers themselves behave differently in their error reporting, and sometimes lib\+S\+B\+ML has to resort to the lowest common denominator.
