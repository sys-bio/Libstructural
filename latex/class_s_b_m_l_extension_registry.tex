\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Registry where package extensions are registered.



This class provides a central registry of all extensions known to lib\+S\+B\+ML. Each package extension must be registered with the registry. The registry class is accessed by various classes to retrieve information about known package extensions and to create additional attributes and/or elements by factory objects of the package extensions.

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The package extension registry is implemented as a singleton instance of \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_registry}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Registry}. The class provides only utility functionality; implementations of S\+B\+ML packages do not need to implement any subclasses or methods of this class. \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension_registry}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension\+Registry} is useful for its facilities to query the known packages, and to enable or disable packages selectively.
