{\ttfamily \#include $<$X\+M\+L\+Output\+Stream.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
The functionality associated with the {\ttfamily program\+Name} and {\ttfamily program\+Version} arguments concerns an optional comment that lib\+S\+B\+ML can write at the beginning of the output stream. The comment is intended for human readers of the X\+ML file, and has the following form\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}<!-- Created by <program name> version <program version>
on yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm with libSBML version <libsbml version>. -->
\end{DoxyVerb}

\end{DoxyParagraph}
This program information comment is a separate item from the X\+ML declaration that this method can also write to this output stream. The comment is also not mandated by any S\+B\+ML specification. This lib\+S\+B\+ML functionality is provided for the convenience of calling programs, and to help humans trace the origin of S\+B\+ML files. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
