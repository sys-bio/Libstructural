\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Simple, plain, generic lists.



This class implements basic vanilla lists for lib\+S\+B\+ML. It was developed in the time before lib\+S\+B\+ML was converted to C++ and used C++ S\+TL library classes more extensively. At some point in the future, this \hyperlink{class_list}{List} class may be removed in favor of using standard C++ classes.

This class is distinct from \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of} because the latter is derived from the S\+B\+ML \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} class, whereas this \hyperlink{class_list}{List} class is not. \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of} can only be used when a list is actually intended to implement an S\+B\+ML List\+OfX class. This is why lib\+S\+B\+ML has both a \hyperlink{class_list}{List} and a \hyperlink{class_list_of}{List\+Of}. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
\hyperlink{_list_8h}{List.\+h}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
