\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{The first element of the list of Formula\+Units\+Data refers to the default}
units of {\itshape \char`\"{}substance per time\char`\"{}} derived from the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object, and has a {\ttfamily unit\+Reference\+Id} attribute of \textquotesingle{}subs\+\_\+per\+\_\+time\textquotesingle{}. This facilitates the comparison of units derived from mathematical formula with the expected units. The next elements of the list record the units of the compartments and species established from either explicitly declared or default units. Following those, the list contains the units of any parameters in the model. Finally, subsequent elements of the list record the units derived for each mathematical expression encountered within the model.
