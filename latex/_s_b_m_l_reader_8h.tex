Reads an S\+B\+ML document from the given file.

If the file named {\ttfamily filename} does not exist or its content is not valid S\+B\+ML, one or more errors will be logged with the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object returned by this method. Callers can use the methods on \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} such as S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Num\+Errors() and

to get the errors. The object returned by

is an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} object, and it has methods to get the error code, category, and severity level of the problem, as well as a textual description of the problem. The possible severity levels range from informational messages to fatal errors; see the documentation for \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} for more information.

If the file {\ttfamily filename} could not be read, the file-\/reading error will appear first. The error code can provide a clue about what happened. For example, a file might be unreadable (either because it does not actually exist or because the user does not have the necessary access priviledges to read it) or some sort of file operation error may have been reported by the underlying operating system. Callers can check for these situations using a program fragment such as the following\+:

\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
If the given filename ends with the suffix {\ttfamily \char`\"{}.\+gz\char`\"{}} (for example, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}myfile.\+xml.\+gz\char`\"{}}), the file is assumed to be compressed in {\itshape gzip} format and will be automatically decompressed upon reading. Similarly, if the given filename ends with {\ttfamily \char`\"{}.\+zip\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily \char`\"{}.\+bz2\char`\"{}}, the file is assumed to be compressed in {\itshape zip} or {\itshape bzip2} format (respectively). Files whose names lack these suffixes will be read uncompressed. Note that if the file is in {\itshape zip} format but the archive contains more than one file, only the first file in the archive will be read and the rest ignored.
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
To read a gzip/zip file, lib\+S\+B\+ML needs to be configured and linked with the \href{http://www.zlib.net/}{\tt zlib} library at compile time. It also needs to be linked with the \href{}{\tt bzip2} library to read files in {\itshape bzip2} format. (Both of these are the default configurations for lib\+S\+B\+ML.) Errors about unreadable files will be logged if a compressed filename is given and lib\+S\+B\+ML was {\itshape not} linked with the corresponding required library.

Reads an S\+B\+ML document from a text string.

This method is flexible with respect to the presence of an X\+ML declaration at the beginning of the string. In particular, if the string in {\ttfamily xml} does not begin with the X\+ML declaration \begin{DoxyVerb}<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
\end{DoxyVerb}
 then this method will automatically prepend the declaration to {\ttfamily xml}.

This method will log a fatal error if the content given in the parameter {\ttfamily xml} is not in S\+B\+ML format. See the method documentation for S\+B\+M\+L\+Reader\+::read\+S\+B\+M\+L() for an example of code for testing the returned error code.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em xml} & a string containing a full S\+B\+ML model.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
a pointer to the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} structure created from the S\+B\+ML content in {\ttfamily xml}.
\end{DoxyReturn}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
When using this method to read an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} that uses the S\+B\+ML Level~3 Hierarchical Model Composition package (comp) the document location cannot be set automatically. Thus, if the model contains references to External\+Model\+Definition objects, it will be necessary to manually set the document U\+RI location (S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::set\+Location\+U\+R\+I() in order to facilitate resolving these models.

Callers can use the methods on \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} such as S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::get\+Num\+Errors() and

to get the errors. The object returned by

is an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} object, and it has methods to get the error code, category, and severity level of the problem, as well as a textual description of the problem. The possible severity levels range from informational messages to fatal errors; see the documentation for \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_error}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Error} for more information.

If the file {\ttfamily filename} could not be read, the file-\/reading error will appear first. The error code can provide a clue about what happened. For example, a file might be unreadable (either because it does not actually exist or because the user does not have the necessary access priviledges to read it) or some sort of file operation error may have been reported by the underlying operating system. Callers can check for these situations using a program fragment such as the following\+:

If the given filename ends with the suffix {\ttfamily \char`\"{}.\+gz\char`\"{}} (for example, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}myfile.\+xml.\+gz\char`\"{}}), the file is assumed to be compressed in {\itshape gzip} format and will be automatically decompressed upon reading. Similarly, if the given filename ends with {\ttfamily \char`\"{}.\+zip\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily \char`\"{}.\+bz2\char`\"{}}, the file is assumed to be compressed in {\itshape zip} or {\itshape bzip2} format (respectively). Files whose names lack these suffixes will be read uncompressed. Note that if the file is in {\itshape zip} format but the archive contains more than one file, only the first file in the archive will be read and the rest ignored.

Lib\+S\+B\+ML versions 2.\+x and later versions behave differently in error handling in several respects. One difference is how early some errors are caught and whether lib\+S\+B\+ML continues processing a file in the face of some early errors. In general, lib\+S\+B\+ML versions after 2.\+x stop parsing S\+B\+ML inputs sooner than lib\+S\+B\+ML version 2.\+x in the face of X\+ML errors, because the errors may invalidate any further S\+B\+ML content. For example, a missing X\+ML declaration at the beginning of the file was ignored by lib\+S\+B\+ML 2.\+x but in version 3.\+x and later, it will cause lib\+S\+B\+ML to stop parsing the rest of the input altogether. While this behavior may seem more severe and intolerant, it was necessary in order to provide uniform behavior regardless of which underlying X\+ML parser (Expat, Xerces, libxml2) is being used by lib\+S\+B\+ML. The X\+ML parsers themselves behave differently in their error reporting, and sometimes lib\+S\+B\+ML has to resort to the lowest common denominator.

Reads an S\+B\+ML document from a text string.

This method is flexible with respect to the presence of an X\+ML declaration at the beginning of the string. In particular, if the string in {\ttfamily xml} does not begin with the X\+ML declaration \begin{DoxyVerb}<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
\end{DoxyVerb}
 then this method will automatically prepend the declaration to {\ttfamily xml}.
