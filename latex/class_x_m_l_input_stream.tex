\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} An interface to an X\+ML input stream.



S\+B\+ML content is serialized using X\+ML; the resulting data can be stored and read to/from a file or data stream. Low-\/level X\+ML parsers such as Xerces provide facilities to read X\+ML data. To permit the use of different X\+ML parsers (Xerces, Expat or libxml2), lib\+S\+B\+ML implements an abstraction layer. \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_input_stream}{X\+M\+L\+Input\+Stream} and \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_output_stream}{X\+M\+L\+Output\+Stream} are two parts of that abstraction layer.

\hyperlink{class_x_m_l_input_stream}{X\+M\+L\+Input\+Stream} is an interface to a file or text string containing X\+ML. It wraps the content to be read, as well as the low-\/level X\+ML parser to be used and an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error_log}{X\+M\+L\+Error\+Log} to record errors and other issues (if any arise). Internally, the content will be in the form of either a pointer to a file name or a character string; \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_input_stream}{X\+M\+L\+Input\+Stream} knows the form of the content and acts appropriately. Other lib\+S\+B\+ML object classes use \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_input_stream}{X\+M\+L\+Input\+Stream} as their interface for all read operations on the X\+ML data. \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_input_stream}{X\+M\+L\+Input\+Stream} provides the functionality to extract data in the form of \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token} objects. It logs any errors encountered while reading. It also keeps track of whether a read operation has failed irrecoverably or determines whether it is safe to continue reading.

\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_namespaces}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces} objects can be associated with an \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_input_stream}{X\+M\+L\+Input\+Stream}; this facilitates logging errors related to reading X\+ML attributes and elements that may only be relevant to particular Level and Version combinations of S\+B\+ML.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The convenience of the \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_input_stream}{X\+M\+L\+Input\+Stream} and \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_output_stream}{X\+M\+L\+Output\+Stream} abstraction may be useful for developers interested in creating parsers for other X\+ML formats besides S\+B\+ML. It can provide developers with a layer above more basic X\+ML parsers, as well as some useful programmatic elements such as \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_token}{X\+M\+L\+Token}, \hyperlink{class_x_m_l_error}{X\+M\+L\+Error}, etc.
