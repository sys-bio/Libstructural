\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Exceptions thrown by some lib\+S\+B\+ML constructors.

In some situations, constructors for S\+B\+ML objects may need to indicate to callers that the creation of the object failed. The failure may be for different reasons, such as an attempt to use invalid parameters or a system condition such as a memory error. To communicate this to callers, those classes will throw an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_constructor_exception}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Constructor\+Exception}.

In languages that don\textquotesingle{}t have an exception mechanism (e.\+g., C), the constructors generally try to return an error code instead of throwing an exception. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
\hyperlink{_s_b_m_l_constructor_exception_8h}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Constructor\+Exception.\+h}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
