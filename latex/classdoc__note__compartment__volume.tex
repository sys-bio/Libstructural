\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The attribute \char`\"{}volume\char`\"{} only exists by that name in S\+B\+ML Level~1. In Level~2 and above, the equivalent attribute is named \char`\"{}size\char`\"{}. In S\+B\+ML Level~1, a compartment\textquotesingle{}s volume has a default value ({\ttfamily 1.\+0}) and therefore methods such as is\+Set\+Volume() will always return {\ttfamily true} for a Level~1 model. In Level~2, a compartment\textquotesingle{}s size (the equivalent of S\+B\+ML Level~1\textquotesingle{}s \char`\"{}volume\char`\"{}) is optional and has no default value, and therefore may or may not be set.
