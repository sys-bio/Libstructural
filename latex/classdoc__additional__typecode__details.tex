\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Here follow some additional general information about lib\+S\+B\+ML type codes\+:
\end{DoxyParagraph}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The codes are the possible return values (integers) for the following functions\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item S\+Base\+::get\+Type\+Code() 
\item List\+Of\+::get\+Item\+Type\+Code() 
\end{DoxyItemize}(Compatibility note\+: in lib\+S\+B\+ML 5, the type of return values of these functions changed from an enumeration to an integer for extensibility in the face of different programming languages.)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Each package extension must define similar sets of values for each \hyperlink{class_s_base}{S\+Base} subclass (e.\+g. {\ttfamily S\+B\+M\+L\+Layout\+Type\+Code\+\_\+t} for the S\+B\+ML Level~3 Layout extension, {\ttfamily S\+B\+M\+L\+Fbc\+Type\+Code\+\_\+t} for the S\+B\+ML Level~3 Flux Balance Constraints extension, etc.).\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The value of each package-\/specific type code can be duplicated between those of different packages. (This is necessary because the development of lib\+S\+B\+ML extensions for different S\+B\+ML packages may be undertaken by different developers at different times; requiring the developers to coordinate their use of type codes would be nettlesome and probably doomed to failure.)\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To distinguish between the type codes of different packages, both the return value of S\+Base\+::get\+Type\+Code() and S\+Base\+::get\+Package\+Name() must be checked. This is particularly important for functions that take an S\+B\+ML type code as an argument, such as S\+Base\+::get\+Ancestor\+Of\+Type(), which by default assumes you are handing it a core type, and will return {\ttfamily N\+U\+LL} if the value you give it is actually from a package.\end{DoxyItemize}
The following example code illustrates the combined use of S\+Base\+::get\+Package\+Name() and S\+Base\+::get\+Type\+Code()\+:
