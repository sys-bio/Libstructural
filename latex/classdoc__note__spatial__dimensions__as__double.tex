\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3, the data type of the \char`\"{}spatial\+Dimensions\char`\"{} attribute is {\ttfamily double}, whereas in Level~2, it is {\ttfamily integer}. To avoid backward compatibility issues, lib\+S\+B\+ML provides two separate methods for obtaining the value as either an integer or a type {\ttfamily double}, for models where it is relevant.
