\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
\hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} elements in S\+B\+ML express a time delay for an \hyperlink{class_event}{Event}. Beginning with S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~2, the units of that time are calculated based on the mathematical expression and the model quantities referenced by {\ttfamily $<$ci$>$} elements used within that expression. (In S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~1, there exists an attribute on \hyperlink{class_event}{Event} called \char`\"{}time\+Units\char`\"{}. This attribute can be used to set the units of the \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} expression explicitly.) The method Delay\+::get\+Derived\+Unit\+Definition() returns what lib\+S\+B\+ML computes the units to be, to the extent that lib\+S\+B\+ML can compute them.
