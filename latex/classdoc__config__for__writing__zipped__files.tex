\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
To write a gzip/zip file, lib\+S\+B\+ML needs to be configured and linked with the \href{http://www.zlib.net/}{\tt zlib} library at compile time. It also needs to be linked with the \href{}{\tt bzip2} library to write files in {\itshape bzip2} format. (Both of these are the default configurations for lib\+S\+B\+ML.) Errors about unreadable files will be logged and this method will return {\ttfamily false} if a compressed filename is given and lib\+S\+B\+ML was {\itshape not} linked with the corresponding required library.
