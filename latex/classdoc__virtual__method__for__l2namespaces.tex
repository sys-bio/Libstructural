\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
This method is related to special facilities designed to support legacy behaviors surrounding S\+B\+ML Level~2 models. Due to the historical background of the S\+B\+ML Layout package, lib\+S\+B\+ML implements special behavior for that package\+: it {\itshape always} creates a Layout plugin object for any S\+B\+ML Level~2 document it reads in, regardless of whether that document actually uses Layout constructs. Since Level~2 does not use namespaces on the top level of the S\+B\+ML document object, lib\+S\+B\+ML simply keys off the fact that the model is a Level~2 model. To allow the extensions for the Layout and Render (and possibly other) packages to support this behavior, the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_extension}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Extension} class contains special methods to allow packages to hook themselves into the Level~2 parsing apparatus when necessary.
