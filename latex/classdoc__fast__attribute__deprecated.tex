\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
In S\+B\+ML Level~3 Version~2, values of {\ttfamily true} for the \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{} attribute were deprecated, and in future versions of the specification, the attribute itself will be removed. Users should be aware that even for previous levels/versions of the specification, the \char`\"{}fast\char`\"{} attribute has never achieved widespread support, and many software packages may ignore it. To achieve the same or similar effects as setting the fast attribute to \char`\"{}true\char`\"{} for a given reaction, the \hyperlink{class_kinetic_law}{Kinetic\+Law} attribute should be constructed to produce a value in the desired time scale, or else the reaction could be replaced with an \hyperlink{class_assignment_rule}{Assignment\+Rule} or \hyperlink{class_algebraic_rule}{Algebraic\+Rule}.
