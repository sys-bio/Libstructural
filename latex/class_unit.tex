\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} A single unit referenced in an S\+B\+ML {\itshape unit definition}.

The S\+B\+ML unit definition facility uses two classes of objects, \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} and \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit}. The approach to defining units in S\+B\+ML is compositional; for example, {\itshape meter second\textsuperscript{ --2}} is constructed by combining a \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} object representing {\itshape meter} with another \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} object representing {\itshape second\textsuperscript{ --2}}. The combination is wrapped inside a \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition}, which provides for assigning an identifier and optional name to the combination. The identifier can then be referenced from elsewhere in a model. Thus, the \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} class is the container, and \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} instances are placed inside \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} instances.

A \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} has four attributes named \char`\"{}kind\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}exponent\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}scale\char`\"{} and \char`\"{}multiplier\char`\"{}. It represents a (possibly transformed) reference to a base unit. The attribute \char`\"{}kind\char`\"{} on \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} indicates the chosen base unit. Its value must be one of the text strings listed below; this list corresponds to S\+B\+ML Level~3\+:

\end{DoxyParagraph}
A few small differences exist between the Level~3 list of base units and the list defined in other Level/\+Version combinations of S\+B\+ML. Specifically, Levels of S\+B\+ML before Level~3 do not define {\ttfamily avogadro}; conversely, Level~2 Version~1 defines {\ttfamily Celsius}, and Level~1 defines {\ttfamily celsius}, {\ttfamily meter}, and {\ttfamily liter}, none of which are available in Level~3. In lib\+S\+B\+ML, each of the predefined base unit names is represented by an enumeration value whose name begins with the characters {\ttfamily U\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+K\+I\+N\+D\+\_\+}, discussed in a separate section below.

The attribute named \char`\"{}exponent\char`\"{} on \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} represents an exponent on the unit. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the attribute is optional and has a default value of {\ttfamily 1} (one); in S\+B\+ML Level~3, the attribute is mandatory and there is no default value. A \hyperlink{class_unit}{Unit} also has an attribute called \char`\"{}scale\char`\"{}; its value must be an integer exponent for a power-\/of-\/ten multiplier used to set the scale of the unit. For example, a unit having a \char`\"{}kind\char`\"{} value of {\ttfamily gram} and a \char`\"{}scale\char`\"{} value of {\ttfamily -\/3} signifies 10\textsuperscript{~--3} $\times$ gram, or milligrams. In S\+B\+ML Level~2, the attribute is optional and has a default value of {\ttfamily 0} (zero), because 10\textsuperscript{ 0} = 1; in S\+B\+ML Level~3, the attribute is mandatory and has no default value. Lastly, the attribute named \char`\"{}multiplier\char`\"{} can be used to multiply the unit by a real-\/numbered factor; this enables the definition of units that are not power-\/of-\/ten multiples of SI units. For instance, a multiplier of 0.\+3048 could be used to define {\ttfamily foot} as a measure of length in terms of a {\ttfamily metre}. The \char`\"{}multiplier\char`\"{} attribute is optional in S\+B\+ML Level~2, where it has a default value of {\ttfamily 1} (one); in S\+B\+ML Level~3, the attribute is mandatory and has not default value.

As discussed above, S\+B\+ML defines a set of base units which serves as the starting point for new unit definitions. This set of base units consists of the SI units and a small number of additional convenience units.

As a consequence of the fact that lib\+S\+B\+ML supports models in all Levels and Versions of S\+B\+ML, lib\+S\+B\+ML\textquotesingle{}s set of {\ttfamily U\+N\+I\+T\+\_\+\+K\+I\+N\+D\+\_\+} values is a union of all the possible base unit names defined in the different S\+B\+ML specifications. However, not every base unit is allowed in every Level+\+Version combination of S\+B\+ML. Note in particular the following exceptions\+: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The alternate spelling {\ttfamily \char`\"{}meter\char`\"{}} is included in addition to the official SI spelling {\ttfamily \char`\"{}metre\char`\"{}}. This spelling is only permitted in S\+B\+ML Level~1 models.


\item The alternate spelling {\ttfamily \char`\"{}liter\char`\"{}} is included in addition to the official SI spelling {\ttfamily \char`\"{}litre\char`\"{}}. This spelling is only permitted in S\+B\+ML Level~1 models.


\item The unit {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\+Celsius\char`\"{}} is included because of its presence in specifications of S\+B\+ML prior to S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~3.


\item The unit {\ttfamily avogadro} was introduced in S\+B\+ML Level~3, and is only permitted for use in S\+B\+ML Level~3 models.
