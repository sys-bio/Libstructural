\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML uses the class \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} as a top-\/level container for storing S\+B\+ML content and data associated with it (such as warnings and error messages). An S\+B\+ML model in lib\+S\+B\+ML is contained inside an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object. \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} corresponds roughly to the class {\itshape S\+B\+ML} defined in the S\+B\+ML Level~3 and Level~2 specifications, but it does not have a direct correspondence in S\+B\+ML Level~1. (But, it is created by lib\+S\+B\+ML no matter whether the model is Level~1, Level~2 or Level~3.)
