\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Abstract class for references to species in reactions.

As mentioned in the description of \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction}, every species that enters into a given reaction must appear in that reaction\textquotesingle{}s lists of reactants, products and/or modifiers. In an S\+B\+ML model, all species that may participate in any reaction are listed in the \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Species\char`\"{} element of the top-\/level \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object. Lists of products, reactants and modifiers in \hyperlink{class_reaction}{Reaction} objects do not introduce new species, but rather, they refer back to those listed in the model\textquotesingle{}s top-\/level \char`\"{}list\+Of\+Species\char`\"{}. For reactants and products, the connection is made using \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} objects; for modifiers, it is made using \hyperlink{class_modifier_species_reference}{Modifier\+Species\+Reference} objects. \hyperlink{class_simple_species_reference}{Simple\+Species\+Reference} is an abstract type that serves as the parent class of both \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} and \hyperlink{class_modifier_species_reference}{Modifier\+Species\+Reference}. It is used simply to hold the attributes and elements that are common to the latter two structures.

The \hyperlink{class_simple_species_reference}{Simple\+Species\+Reference} structure has a mandatory attribute, \char`\"{}species\char`\"{}, which must be a text string conforming to the identifer syntax permitted in S\+B\+ML. This attribute is inherited by the \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} and \hyperlink{class_modifier_species_reference}{Modifier\+Species\+Reference} subclasses derived from \hyperlink{class_simple_species_reference}{Simple\+Species\+Reference}. The value of the \char`\"{}species\char`\"{} attribute must be the identifier of a species defined in the enclosing \hyperlink{class_model}{Model}. The species is thereby declared as participating in the reaction being defined. The precise role of that species as a reactant, product, or modifier in the reaction is determined by the subclass of \hyperlink{class_simple_species_reference}{Simple\+Species\+Reference} (i.\+e., either \hyperlink{class_species_reference}{Species\+Reference} or \hyperlink{class_modifier_species_reference}{Modifier\+Species\+Reference}) in which the identifier appears.

\hyperlink{class_simple_species_reference}{Simple\+Species\+Reference} also contains an optional attribute, \char`\"{}id\char`\"{}, allowing instances to be referenced from other structures. No S\+B\+ML structures currently do this; however, such structures are anticipated in future S\+B\+ML Levels.
