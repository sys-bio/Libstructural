{\ttfamily \#include $<$Delay.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
Note that it is possible the \char`\"{}math\char`\"{} expression in the \hyperlink{class_delay}{Delay} contains literal numbers or parameters with undeclared units. In those cases, it is not possible to calculate the units of the overall expression without making assumptions. Lib\+S\+B\+ML does not make assumptions about the units, and Delay\+::get\+Derived\+Unit\+Definition() only returns the units as far as it is able to determine them. For example, in an expression {\itshape X + Y}, if {\itshape X} has unambiguously-\/defined units and {\itshape Y} does not, it will return the units of {\itshape X}. When using this method, {\bfseries it is critical that callers also invoke the method} Delay\+::contains\+Undeclared\+Units() {\bfseries to determine whether this situation holds}. Callers should take suitable action in those situations.
