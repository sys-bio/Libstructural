\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This method should be used with some caution. The fact that this method {\itshape copies} the object passed to it means that the caller will be left holding a physically different object instance than the one contained inside this object. Changes made to the original object instance (such as resetting attribute values) will {\itshape not affect the instance in this object}. In addition, the caller should make sure to free the original object if it is no longer being used, or else a memory leak will result. Please see other methods on this class (particularly a corresponding method whose name begins with the word {\ttfamily create}) for alternatives that do not lead to these issues.
