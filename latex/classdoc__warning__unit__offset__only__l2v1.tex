\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyWarning}{Warning}
The \char`\"{}offset\char`\"{} attribute is only available in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~1. This attribute is not present in S\+B\+ML Level~2 Version~2 or above. When producing S\+B\+ML models using these later specifications, modelers and software tools need to account for units with offsets explicitly. The S\+B\+ML specification document offers a number of suggestions for how to achieve this. Lib\+S\+B\+ML methods such as this one related to \char`\"{}offset\char`\"{} are retained for compatibility with earlier versions of S\+B\+ML Level~2, but their use is strongly discouraged.
