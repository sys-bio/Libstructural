\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
S\+B\+ML Level~3 consists of a {\itshape Core} definition that can be extended via optional S\+B\+ML Level~3 {\itshape packages}. A given model may indicate that it uses one or more S\+B\+ML packages, and likewise, a software tool may be able to support one or more packages. Lib\+S\+B\+ML does not come preconfigured with all possible packages included and enabled, in part because not all package specifications have been finalized. To support the ability for software systems to enable support for the Level~3 packages they choose, lib\+S\+B\+ML features a {\itshape plug-\/in} mechanism. Each S\+B\+ML Level~3 package is implemented in a separate code plug-\/in that can be enabled by the application to support working with that S\+B\+ML package. A given S\+B\+ML model may thus contain not only objects defined by S\+B\+ML Level~3 Core, but also objects created by lib\+S\+B\+ML plug-\/ins supporting additional Level~3 packages.
