\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
There are a number of methods for interrogating the type of an \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} and for testing whether a node belongs to a general category of constructs. The methods on \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} for this purpose are the following\+:
\end{DoxyParagraph}
Programs manipulating A\+ST node structures should check the type of a given node before calling methods that return a value from the node. The following are the \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} object methods available for returning values from nodes\+:

Of course, all of this would be of little use if lib\+S\+B\+ML didn\textquotesingle{}t also provide methods for {\itshape setting} the values of A\+ST node objects! And it does. The methods are the following\+:

Finally, \hyperlink{class_a_s_t_node}{A\+S\+T\+Node} also defines some miscellaneous methods for manipulating A\+S\+Ts\+: 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
