\subsection{Detailed Description}
\begin{DoxyParagraph}{}
If the given filename ends with the suffix {\ttfamily \char`\"{}.\+gz\char`\"{}} (for example, {\ttfamily \char`\"{}myfile.\+xml.\+gz\char`\"{}}), the file is assumed to be compressed in {\itshape gzip} format and will be automatically decompressed upon reading. Similarly, if the given filename ends with {\ttfamily \char`\"{}.\+zip\char`\"{}} or {\ttfamily \char`\"{}.\+bz2\char`\"{}}, the file is assumed to be compressed in {\itshape zip} or {\itshape bzip2} format (respectively). Files whose names lack these suffixes will be read uncompressed. Note that if the file is in {\itshape zip} format but the archive contains more than one file, only the first file in the archive will be read and the rest ignored.
