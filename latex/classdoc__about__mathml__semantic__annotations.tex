{\ttfamily \#include $<$A\+S\+T\+Node.\+h$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
The {\ttfamily $<$semantics$>$} element is a Math\+ML~2.\+0 construct that can be used to associate additional information with a Math\+ML construct. The construct can be used to decorate a Math\+ML expressions with a sequence of one or more {\ttfamily $<$annotation$>$} or {\ttfamily $<$annotation-\/xml$>$} elements. Each such element contains a pair of items; the first is a symbol that acts as an attribute or key, and the second is the value associated with the attribute or key. Please refer to the Math\+ML~2.\+0 documentation, particularly the \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-MathML3-20071005/chapter5.html#mixing.semantic.annotations}{\tt Section 5.\+2, Semantic Annotations} for more information about these constructs.
