\subsection{Detailed Description}
\{core\} Whole-\/document S\+B\+ML Level/\+Version converter.



This S\+B\+ML converter takes an S\+B\+ML document having one S\+B\+ML Level+\+Version combination, and attempts to convert it to an S\+B\+ML document having a different Level+\+Version combination.

This class is also the basis for S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::set\+Level\+And\+Version().\hypertarget{class_s_b_m_l_level_version_converter_SBMLLevelVersionConverter-usage}{}\subsection{Configuration and use of S\+B\+M\+L\+Level\+Version\+Converter}\label{class_s_b_m_l_level_version_converter_SBMLLevelVersionConverter-usage}
\hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_level_version_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Level\+Version\+Converter} is enabled by creating a \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object with the option {\ttfamily \char`\"{}set\+Level\+And\+Version\char`\"{}}, and passing this properties object to S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::convert(). The target S\+B\+ML Level and Version combination are determined by the value of the S\+B\+ML namespace set on the \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object (using Conversion\+Properties\+::set\+Target\+Namespaces(\+S\+B\+M\+L\+Namespaces $\ast$target\+N\+S)).

In addition, this converter offers the following options\+:

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \char`\"{}strict\char`\"{}}\+: If this option has the value {\ttfamily true}, then the validity of the S\+B\+ML document will be strictly preserved. This means that S\+B\+ML validation will be performed, and if the original model is not valid or semantics cannot be preserved in the converted model, then conversion will not be performed. Conversely, if this option is set to {\ttfamily false}, model conversion will always be performed; if any errors are detected related to altered semantics, the errors will be logged in the usual way (i.\+e., the error log on the \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object).\end{DoxyItemize}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \char`\"{}add\+Default\+Units\char`\"{}}\+: By default, a conversion from S\+B\+ML Level~2 to Level~3 will explicitly add \hyperlink{class_unit_definition}{Unit\+Definition} objects and unit attributes on the \hyperlink{class_model}{Model} object to define units that are implicitly defined in S\+B\+ML Level~2. This is usually desirable because in S\+B\+ML Level~3, there are no default units and a conversion from Level~2 that did {\itshape not} add unit definitions would actually result in a loss of information. However, some users or software tools may not need or want this, or worse, may be fooled into thinking that lib\+S\+B\+ML has somehow inferred the proper units for model quantities. (It has not; it merely adds generic predefined units.) This option lets callers control this behavior.\end{DoxyItemize}
\hypertarget{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_using-converters}{}\subsection{General information about the use of S\+B\+M\+L converters}\label{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_using-converters}
The use of all the converters follows a similar approach. First, one creates a \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object and calls Conversion\+Properties\+::add\+Option() on this object with one argument\+: a text string that identifies the desired converter. (The text string is specific to each converter; consult the documentation for a given converter to find out how it should be enabled.)

Next, for some converters, the caller can optionally set some converter-\/specific properties using additional calls to Conversion\+Properties\+::add\+Option(). Many converters provide the ability to configure their behavior to some extent; this is realized through the use of properties that offer different options. The default property values for each converter can be interrogated using the method S\+B\+M\+L\+Converter\+::get\+Default\+Properties() on the converter class in question .

Finally, the caller should invoke the method S\+B\+M\+L\+Document\+::convert() with the \hyperlink{class_conversion_properties}{Conversion\+Properties} object as an argument.\hypertarget{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_converter-example}{}\subsubsection{Example of invoking an S\+B\+M\+L converter}\label{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_converter-example}
The following code fragment illustrates an example using \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reaction_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reaction\+Converter}, which is invoked using the option string {\ttfamily \char`\"{}replace\+Reactions\char`\"{}}\+:

In the case of \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_reaction_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Reaction\+Converter}, there are no options to affect its behavior, so the next step is simply to invoke the converter on an \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_document}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Document} object. Continuing the example code\+:

Here is an example of using a converter that offers an option. The following code invokes \hyperlink{class_s_b_m_l_strip_package_converter}{S\+B\+M\+L\+Strip\+Package\+Converter} to remove the S\+B\+ML Level~3 {\itshape Layout} package from a model. It sets the name of the package to be removed by adding a value for the option named {\ttfamily \char`\"{}package\char`\"{}} defined by that converter\+:\hypertarget{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_available-converters}{}\subsubsection{Available S\+B\+M\+L converters in lib\+S\+B\+ML}\label{classdoc__section__using__sbml__converters_available-converters}
Lib\+S\+B\+ML provides a number of built-\/in converters; by convention, their names end in {\itshape Converter}. The following are the built-\/in converters provided by lib\+S\+B\+ML \+:
